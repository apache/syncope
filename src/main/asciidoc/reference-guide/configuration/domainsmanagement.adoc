=== Domains Management

Besides the pre-defined `Master` domain, other <<domains>> are bootstrapped during <<core>> startup from three files
in the <<properties-files-location,configuration directory>>; assuming that the domain name is `Two`, such files are:

* `domains/TwoSecurity.json` - admin credentials;
* `domains/TwoKeymasterConfParams.json` - for <<keymaster>> initialization;
* `domains/TwoContent.xml` - for <<import,content>> initialization.

[TIP]
Starting from Syncope 3.0 it is also possible to create, update and delete Domains at runtime by managing the related
configuration on the configured <<keymaster>> instance.
