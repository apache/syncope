===== OpenJPA

When deploying multiple Syncope <<core>> instances with a single database or database cluster, it is of
fundamental importance that the contained OpenJPA instances are correctly configured for
https://openjpa.apache.org/builds/3.2.2/apache-openjpa/docs/ref_guide_event.html[remote event notification^]. +
Such configuration, in fact, allows the OpenJPA data cache to remain synchronized when deployed in multiple JVMs, thus
enforcing data consistency across all Syncope Core instances.

The default configuration in `core.properties` is

[source]
....
persistence.remoteCommitProvider=sjvm
....

which is suited for single JVM installations; with multiple instances, more options like as TCP or JMS are available;
see the OpenJPA documentation for reference.

[WARNING]
====
The https://openjpa.apache.org/builds/3.2.2/apache-openjpa/docs/ref_guide_event.html[OpenJPA documentation^]'s XML
snippets refer to a different configuration style; for example, when used in `core.properties`, this:

[source,xml]
....
<property name="openjpa.RemoteCommitProvider" value="tcp(Addresses=10.0.1.10;10.0.1.11,TransmitPersistedObjectIds=true)"/>
....

becomes:

[source]
....
persistence.remoteCommitProvider=tcp(Addresses=10.0.1.10;10.0.1.11,TransmitPersistedObjectIds=true)
....
