=== Install connector bundles

<<connector-bundles,Connector bundles>> are made available as JAR files and can be configured, for a given deployment:

* for Maven project, in local sources;
* for all distributions, at run-time.

==== Local sources

===== Different version of predefined connector bundle

First of all, verify which connector bundles are predefined in your project by looking at your project's parent
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/syncope/syncope/{docVersion}[POM^].
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/syncope/syncope/{docVersion}[POM^].
endif::[]

As you can see, there are several Maven properties on the form `connid.*.version`, controlling the related connector
bundle's version.

If you want your own project to use a different version of a given connector bundle, all you need to do is to override
the related property in your own project's root pom.xml.

Hence, supposing that you would like to use `net.tirasa.connid.bundles.db.table` version `2.2.8-SNAPSHOT` rather than
`2.2.7` shipped with Apache Syncope, add the following property to your own project's root `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
....
<properties>
   ...
   <connid.database.version>2.2.8-SNAPSHOT</connid.database.version>
</properties>
....

===== Non-predefined connector bundle

If the needed connector bundle is not in the predefined set as shown above, you will need to add a new property into
your own project's root `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
....
<properties>
   ...
   <my.new.connector.version>1.0.0</my.new.connector.version>
</properties>
....

then change the `maven-dependency-plugin` configuration both in `core/pom.xml` and `console/pom.xml` from

[source,xml]
....
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
  <inherited>true</inherited>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>set-bundles</id>
      <phase>process-test-resources</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>copy</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
....

to

[source,xml]
....
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
  <inherited>true</inherited>
  <configuration>                
    <artifactItems>
      <artifactItem>
        <groupId>my.new.connector.groupId</groupId>
        <artifactId>my.new.connector.artifactId</artifactId>
        <version>${my.new.connector.version}</version>
      </artifactItem>
    </artifactItems>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>set-bundles</id>
      <phase>process-test-resources</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>copy</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
....

==== Run-time

Connector bundles can be added or replaced at run-time by performing the following steps:

. https://github.com/Tirasa/ConnId/#available-connectors[Download^] the required connector bundle
JAR file;
. Copy the downloaded JAR file into one of configured <<connid-locations>>, typically the
`bundles` directory where the other connector bundles are already available.
