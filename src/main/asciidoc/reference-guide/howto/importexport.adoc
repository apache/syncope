=== Internal storage export - import

Almost every configurable aspect of a given deployment is contained in the <<persistence,internal storage>>:
schemas, connectors, resources, mapping, roles, groups, tasks and other parameters.

During the implementation phase of an Apache Syncope-based project, it might be useful to move such configuration back
and forth from one Apache Syncope instance to another (say developer's laptop and production server). +
One option is clearly to act at a low level by empowering DBMS' dump & restore capabilities, but what if the developer is
running MySQL (or even in-memory H2) while the sysadmin features Oracle?

[CAUTION]
.Wipe existing content
=====
When not running in-memory H2, the internal storage's content must be wiped before starting Apache Syncope, otherwise
the provided content will be just ignored.

Check `core-persistence.log` for message

....
Empty database found, loading default content
....

If the internal storage is not empty, instead, you will get

....
Data found in the database, leaving untouched
....
=====

[WARNING]
=====
All references in the following are set to `MasterContent.xml`; when other <<domains,domains>> are defined, the content
file is renamed accordingly. For example, `TwoContent.xml` if domain name is `Two`.
=====

[WARNING]
.MySQL and lower case table names
=====
On some platforms (namely, Mac OS X) MySQL is configured by default to be case insensitive: in such cases, you might
want to edit the `/etc/my.cnf` file and add the following line in the `[mysqld]` section:

....
lower_case_table_names=1
....
=====

==== Export

This task can be accomplished either via the admin console or by barely invoking the REST layer through
http://curl.haxx.se/[curl^], for example:

....
curl -X GET -u admin:password -o MasterContent.xml \
  http://localhost:9080/syncope/rest/configurations/stream
....

==== Import

Basically, all you need to do is to replace the local `MasterContent.xml` with the one exported as explained above; this
file is located at:


* `$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/syncope/WEB-INF/classes/domains/MasterContent.xml` for Standalone
* `core/src/test/resources/domains/MasterContent.xml` for Maven projects in embedded mode
* `core/src/main/resources/domains/MasterContent.xml` for Maven projects
