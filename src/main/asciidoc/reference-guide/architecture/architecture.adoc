== Architecture

Apache Syncope is made of several components, which are logically summarized in the picture below.

include::core.adoc[]

[[admin-console-component]]
=== Admin UI

The Admin UI is the web-based console for configuring and administering running deployments, with full support
for delegated administration.

The communication between Admin UI and Core is exclusively REST-based.

More details are available in the dedicated <<admin-console,usage>> section.

[[enduser-component]]
=== End-user UI

The End-user UI is the web-based application for self-registration, self-service and password reset.

The communication between End-user UI and Core is exclusively REST-based.

[[cli-component]]
=== CLI

The command-line interface (CLI) client is an utility tool meant for interacting with Apache Syncope deployments from 
shell scripts.

The communication between CLI and Core is exclusively REST-based.

More details are available in the dedicated <<cli,usage>> section.

=== Third Party Applications

Third-party applications are provided full access to IdM services by leveraging the REST interface, either via the 
Java <<client-library,Client Library>> (the basis of Admin UI, End-user UI and CLI) or plain HTTP calls.

==== Eclipse IDE Plugin

The Eclipse IDE plugin allows remote management of notification e-mail and report templates and constitutes an example
of Java application relying on the Client Library for interacting with Core via REST.
