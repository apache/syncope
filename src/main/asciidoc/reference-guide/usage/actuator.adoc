=== Actuator Endpoints

Spring Boot's actuator endpoints let you monitor and interact with Syncope components.

Each individual endpoint can be enabled / disabled and exposed over HTTP (pre-defined, under the `/actuator` subcontext)
or JMX.

Besides a number of https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/3.4/reference/actuator/endpoints.html[built-in endpoints^],
more are made available for each component, as reported below.

[NOTE]
The pre-defined `health` and `info` endpoints are extended by each Syncope component, to add sensible data for the
given component.

[TIP]
The pre-defined `health` endpoint is typically used for liveness and readiness probes, even with Kubernetes.
