=== Enduser Application
Once the deployment is ready, the enduser application can be accessed at:

....
protocol://host:port/syncope-enduser/
....

where `protocol`, `host` and `port` reflect your deployment.

The scope of the enduser application is primarily to provide a dedicated web-based entry-point for self-registration,
self-service and <<password-reset,password reset>>.
