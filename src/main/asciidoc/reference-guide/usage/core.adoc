=== Core

All the features provided by the <<core>> are available as RESTful services.

The base URL for invoking such services is normally set as

....
protocol://host:port/syncope/rest/
....

where `protocol`, `host` and `port` reflect your deployment.

[NOTE]
.REST Reference
====
A complete REST reference generated from https://swagger.io/specification/[OpenAPI specification 3.0^] is
https://syncope.apache.org/rest/3.0/openapi.json[published^] as well as made available with each deployment at

....
protocol://host:port/syncope/rest/openapi.json
....

where `protocol`, `host` and `port` reflect your deployment.

REST APIs are available to visualize and interact via https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI^] at

....
protocol://host:port/syncope/
....
====

==== REST Authentication and Authorization

The <<core>> authentication and authorization is based on https://spring.io/projects/spring-security[Spring Security^].

As an initial step, authentication is required to obtain, in the `X-Syncope-Token` HTTP header, the
unique signed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token[JSON Web Token^] to include in all subsequent requests.

By providing the token received in the initial exchange, the requester can be identified and checked for authorization,
based on owned <<entitlements,entitlements>>.

[NOTE]
Users can examine their own entitlements looking at the `<<x-syncope-entitlements,X-Syncope-Entitlements>>`
header value, and their own privileges looking at the `<<x-syncope-privileges,X-Syncope-Privileges>>` header value.

[TIP]
====
The relevant security configuration lies in
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/spring/src/main/resources/securityContext.xml[securityContext.xml^];
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/core/spring/src/main/resources/securityContext.xml[securityContext.xml^];
endif::[]
while normally not needed, this configuration can be anyway customized via the <<override-behavior,override behavior>>.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication[HTTP Basic Authentication] is set for use by default.
====

===== JWTSSOProvider

Besides validating and accepting the JSON Web Tokens generated during the authentication process as sketched above,
Apache Syncope can be enabled to cope with tokens generated by third parties, by providing implementations of the
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/spring/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/spring/security/JWTSSOProvider.java[JWTSSOProvider^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/tree/master/core/spring/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/spring/security/JWTSSOProvider.java[JWTSSOProvider^]
endif::[]
interface.

[[authorization-summary]]
.Authorization Summary
****
The set of RESTful services provided by Apache Syncope can be divided as:

. endpoints accessible without any sort of authentication (e.g. truly anonymous), for self-registration and
<<password-reset,password reset>>;
. endpoints disclosing information about the given Syncope deployment (available <<schema,schema>>, configured
<<extensions,extensions>>, Groups, ...), requiring some sort of shared authentication defined by the
`anonymousKey` value  in the `security.properties` file - for more information, read about Spring Security's
https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.5.x/reference/html5/#anonymous[Anonymous Authentication^];
. endpoints for self-service (self-update, password change, ...), requiring user authentication and no entitlements;
. endpoints for administrative operations, requiring user authentication with authorization granted by the related
<<entitlements,entitlements>>, handed over to users via <<roles,roles>>.
****

==== REST Headers

Apache Syncope supports a number of HTTP headers as detailed below, in addition to the common HTTP headers such as
`Accept`, `Content-Type`, etc.

[TIP]
It is possible to deal with the headers below when using the <<client-library>> via the `SyncopeClient` class methods.

===== X-Syncope-Token

`X-Syncope-Token` is returned on response to <<rest-authentication-and-authorization,successful authentication>>, and
contains the unique signed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token[JSON Web Token^] identifying the authenticated
user.

The value returned for the `X-Syncope-Token` header must be included in all subsequent requests, in order for the
requester to be checked for authorization, as part of the standard https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750[Bearer^]
`Authorization` header.

.Obtaining JWT with http://curl.haxx.se/[curl^] 
====
....
curl -I -u admin:password -X POST http://localhost:9080/syncope/rest/accessTokens/login
....
returns
....
HTTP/1.1 204 
X-Syncope-Token: eyJ0e..
....
which can then be used to make a call to the REST API
.....
curl -I -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0e.." http://localhost:9080/syncope/rest/users/self
.....
====

The token duration can be configured via the `jwt.lifetime.minutes` property - see
<<configuration-parameters, below>> for details.

===== X-Syncope-Domain

`X-Syncope-Domain` can be optionally set for requests (when not set, `Master` is assumed) to select the target
<<domains,domain>>. +
The value for this header is provided in all responses.

===== X-Syncope-Key and Location

When creating an entity (User, Group, Schema, External Resource, ...) these two headers are populated respectively with
the entity key (which may be auto-generated) and the absolute URI identifying the new REST resource.

===== X-Application-Error-Code and X-Application-Error-Info

If the requested operation is in error, `X-Application-Error-Code` will contain the error code (mostly from
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/common/idrepo/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/types/ClientExceptionType.java[ClientExceptionType^])
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/common/idrepo/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/types/ClientExceptionType.java[ClientExceptionType^])
endif::[]
and `X-Application-Error-Info` might be optionally populated with more details, if available.

===== X-Syncope-Delegated-By

When requesting an operation under <<delegation,Delegation>>, this header must be provided to indicate the delegating
User, either by their username or key.

===== X-Syncope-Null-Priority-Async

When set to `true`, this request header instructs the <<propagation,propagation process>> not to wait for completion
when communicating with <<external-resource-details,External Resources>> with no priority set.

===== Prefer and Preference-Applied

Some REST endpoints allow the clients to request certain behavior; this is done via the `Prefer` header.

When `Prefer` is specified in the request, the response will feature the `Preference-Applied` header, with value set
to the effective preference applied.

====== return-content / return-no-content
 
REST endpoints for creating, updating or deleting Users, Groups or Any Objects return the entity in the response payload
by default. +
If this is not required, the `Prefer` request header can be set to `return-no-content` (`return-content` will instead
keep the default behavior).

[TIP]
Use `Prefer: return-no-content` in scenarios where it is important to avoid unnecessary data in the response payload.

====== respond-async

The <<batch>> endpoint can be requested for <<asynchronous-batch-processing,asynchronous processing>>.

===== ETag, If-Match and If-None-Match

For each response containing Users, Groups or Any Objects, the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag[ETag^] header is
generated, which contains the latest modification date.

This value can be passed, during subsequent requests to modify the same entity, via the `If-Match` or
`If-None-Match` headers. +
When the provided `If-Match` value does not match the latest modification date of the entity, an error is reported and
the requested operation is not performed.

[TIP]
The combined usage of `ETag` and `If-Match` can be enforced to implement optimistic concurrency control over Users,
Groups and Any Objects operations.

===== X-Syncope-Entitlements

When invoking the REST endpoint `/users/self` in `GET`, the `X-Syncope-Entitlements` response header will list all
the <<entitlements,entitlements>> owned by the requesting user.

===== X-Syncope-Delegations

When invoking the REST endpoint `/users/self` in `GET`, the `X-Syncope-Delegations` response header will list all
delegating users for each <<delegation,Delegation>> for which the requesting user is delegated.

===== X-Syncope-Privileges

When invoking the REST endpoint `/users/self` in `GET`, the `X-Syncope-Privileges` response header will list all
the <<privileges,privileges>> owned by the requesting user.

==== Batch

Batch requests allow grouping multiple operations into a single HTTP request payload. +
A batch request is represented as a https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046[Multipart MIME v1.0 message^], a standard format
allowing the representation of multiple parts, each of which may have a different content type (currently
JSON, YAML or XML), within a single request.

Batch requests are handled by the `/batch` REST endpoint: via HTTP `POST` method to submit requests, via HTTP `GET`
method to fetch responses <<asynchronous-batch-processing,asynchronously>>.

[NOTE]
The specification and implementation of batch processing in Apache Syncope is inspired by the standards defined
by http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/os/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-os-part1-protocol.html#_Toc372793748[OData 4.0^]

===== Batch requests

The batch request must contain a `Content-Type` header specifying a content type of `multipart/mixed` and a boundary
specification as defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046[RFC2046^].

The body of a batch request is made up of a series of individual requests, each represented as a distinct MIME part
(i.e. separated by the boundary defined in the `Content-Type` header).

Core will process the requests within a batch request sequentially.

An individual request must include a `Content-Type` header with value `application/http` and a
`Content-Transfer-Encoding` header with value `binary`.

====

===== Batch responses

Requests within a batch are evaluated according to the same semantics used when the request appears outside the context
of a batch.

The order of individual requests in a batch request is significant.

If the set of request headers of a batch request are valid (the `Content-Type` is set to `multipart/mixed`, etc.)
Core will return a `200 OK` HTTP response code to indicate that the request was accepted for processing, and the
related execution results.

If Core receives a batch request with an invalid set of headers it will return a `400 Bad Request` code and perform no
further processing of the request.

A response to a batch request must contain a `Content-Type` header with value `multipart/mixed`.

Structurally, a batch response body must match one-to-one with the corresponding batch request body, such that the same 
multipart MIME message structure defined for requests is used for responses

====

===== Asynchronous Batch Processing

Batch requests may be executed asynchronously by <<respond-async,including>> the `respond-async` preference in the
`Prefer` header.

Core will return an empty response, with status `202 Accepted`.

Clients can poll the `/batch` endpoint in `GET` by passing the same boundary used for request: if `202 Accepted` is
returned, then the request is still under processing; otherwise, `200 OK` will be returned, along with the full batch
response. +
Once retrieved, the batch response is not available any more from the `/batch` endpoint.

==== Search

It is possible to search for Users, Groups and Any Objects matching a set of given conditions expressed through
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-rs-search.html#JAX-RSSearch-FeedItemQueryLanguage[FIQL^].

The https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-atompub-fiql-00[Feed Item Query Language^] (FIQL, pronounced “fickle”)
is a simple but flexible, URI-friendly syntax for expressing filters across the entries in a syndicated feed.

The FIQL queries can be passed (among other parameters) to the search endpoints available, e.g.

* `GET /users?fiql=query`
* `GET /groups?fiql=query`
* `GET /anyObjects?fiql=query`
* `GET /resources/{resource}/{anytype}?fiql=query`

where:

* `query` is an URL-encoded string representation of the given FIQL query, as in the following examples;
* `resource` is one of defined <<external-resources,external resources>>;
* `anytype` is one of defined <<anytype,any types>>.

===== Sorting Search Results

Search results can be requested for sorting by passing the optional `orderBy` query parameter to the search endpoints
available, e.g.

* `GET /users?fiql=query&orderBy=sort`
* `GET /groups?fiql=query&orderBy=sort`
* `GET /anyObjects?fiql=query&orderBy=sort`
* `GET /resources/{resource}/{anytype}?orderBy=sort`

where `sort` is an URL-encoded string representation of the sort request, as in the following examples.

.Single attribute sort, default direction (`ASC`)
