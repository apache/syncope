== Preface
This guide covers Apache Syncope services for:

* identity management, provisioning and compliance; 
* access management, single sign-on, authentication and authorization;
* API gateway, secure proxy, service mesh, request routing.

== Introduction

*Apache Syncope* is an Open Source system for managing digital identities in enterprise environments, implemented in 
Jakarta EE technology and released under the Apache 2.0 license. 

Often, _Identity Management_ and _Access Management_ are jointly referred, mainly because their two management worlds
likely coexist in the same project or in the same environment.

The two topics are however completely different: each one has its own context, its own rules, its own best practices.

On the other hand, some products provide unorthodox implementations so it is indeed possible to do the same thing with 
both of them.

****
Identity Management:: Tools and practices to keep identity data consistent and synchronized across repositories, data 
formats and models.
Access Management:: Systems, protocols and technologies supporting user authentication (how Users are let accessing a
given system) and authorization (which capabilities each user owns on a given system).
****

From the definitions above, Identity Management and Access Management can be seen as complementary: very often, the data
synchronized by the former are then used by the latter to provide its features - e.g. authentication and authorization.
