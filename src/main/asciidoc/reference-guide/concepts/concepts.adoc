=== Delegated Administration

The idea is that any user U assigned to a role R, which provides entitlements E~1~...E~n~ for realms Re~1~...Re~k~ can 
exercise E~i~ on entities (users or groups, depending on the type of E~i~) under any Re~j~ or related sub-realms.

About group membership and any relationships:

* User U can be member of group G either if U and G are in the same realm, or G is in one of super-realms of the realm 
of U
* Any object A~1~ can be in relationship with any object A~2~ either if A~1~ and A~2~ are in the same realm, or A~2~ is
in one of super-realms of the realm of A~1~

The rationale behind such conditions is to allow the definition of common groups and any objects (to enter in 
relationship with) at the topmost position in the realm tree, so that they can be shared by various realm sub-trees.

==== Example

Let's suppose that we want to implement the following scenario:

****
Administrator A can create users under realm R~5~ but not under realm R~7~, administrator B can update users under 
realm R~6~ and R~8~, administrator C can update groups under realm R~8~.
****

As default, Syncope will have defined the following entitlements, among others:

* `USER_CREATE`
* `USER_UPDATE`
* `GROUP_UPDATE`

Here it follows how entitlements should be assigned (via roles) to administrators in order to implement the scenario 
above:

* A: `USER_CREATE` on R~5~
* B: `USER_UPDATE` on R~6~ and R~8~
* C: `GROUP_UPDATE` on R~8~
