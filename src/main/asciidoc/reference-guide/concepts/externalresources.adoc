=== External Resources

****
Connector Bundles:: The components able to connect to Identity Stores; not specifically bound to Apache Syncope, 
as they are part of the http://connid.tirasa.net[ConnId^] project.
Connector Instances:: Instances of connector bundles, obtained by assigning values to the defined configuration 
properties. For instance, there is only a single `DatabaseTable` (the bundle) that can be instantiated
several times, for example if there is a need to connect to different databases.
External Resources:: Meant to encapsulate all information about how Apache Syncope will use connector instances for 
provisioning. For each entity supported by the related connector bundle (user, group, printer, services, ...),
<<mapping,mapping>> information can be specified.
****

==== Connector Instance details

When defining a connector instance, the following information must be provided:

* connector bundle - one of the several
https://github.com/Tirasa/ConnId/blob/master/README.md#available-connectors[already available^], or some to be
https://connid.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BASE/Create+new+connector[made from scratch^], in order to fulfill specific
requirements
* pooling information
* configuration - depending on the selected bundle, these are properties with configuration values: for example,
with https://connid.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BASE/LDAP#LDAP-Configuration[LDAP^] this means host, port, bind DN,
object classes while with
https://connid.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BASE/Database+Table#DatabaseTable-ConfigurationProperties[DBMS^] it would 
be JDBC URL, table name, etc.
* capabilities - define what operations are allowed on this connector: during <<provisioning,provisioning>>, if a
certain operation is invoked but the corresponding capability is not set on the related connector instance, no actual
action is performed on the underlying connector; the capabilities are:
** `AUTHENTICATE` - consent to <<pass-through-authentication, pass-through authentication>>
** `CREATE` - create objects on the underlying connector
** `UPDATE` - update objects on the underlying connector
** `DELETE` - delete objects on the underlying connector
** `SEARCH` - search / read objects from the underlying connector; used during <<provisioning-pull,pull>> with 
`FULL RECONCILIATION` or `FILTERED RECONCILIATION` <<pull-mode,mode>>
** `SYNC` - synchronize objects from the underlying connector; used during <<provisioning-pull,pull>> with 
`INCREMENTAL` <<pull-mode,mode>> 

[TIP]
.Configuration and capability override
====
Capabilities and individual configuration properties can be set for _override_: in this case, all the external resources
using the given connector instance will have the chance to override some configuration values, or the capabilities set.

This can be useful when the same connector instance is shared among different resources, with little difference in the
required configuration or capabilities.
====

==== External Resource details

Given a selected connector instance, the following information is required to define an external resource:

* priority - integer value, in use by the default <<propagation,propagation task executor>>
* generate random password flag - under some circumstances, a password might be mandatory but no actual value could be
available: with this flag set, a random value will be generated, compliant with the defined
<<policies-password,password policy>> (if set)
* propagation actions - which <<propagationactions,actions>> shall be executed during propagation
* trace levels - control how much tracing (including logs and execution details) shall be carried over during
<<propagation,propagation>>, <<provisioning-pull,pull>> and <<provisioning-push,push>>
* configuration - see <<connector-instance-details,above>>
* capabilities - see <<connector-instance-details,above>>
* account policy - which <<policies-account,account policy>> to enforce on Users, Groups and Any Objects assigned to
this external resource
* password policy - which <<policies-password,password policy>> to enforce on Users, Groups and Any Objects assigned to
this external resource
* pull policy - which <<policies-pull,pull policy>> to apply during <<provisioning-pull,pull>> on this external
resource
* push policy - which <<policies-push,push policy>> to apply during <<provisioning-push,push>> on this external
resource

==== Mapping

The mapping between internal and external data is of crucial importance when
configuring an external resource. Such information, in fact, plays a key role for <<provisioning,provisioning>>.

[.text-center]
image::mapping.png[title="Sample mapping",alt="Sample mapping"]

For each of the <<anytype,Any Types>> supported by the underlying connector, a different mapping is provided.

A mapping is essentially a collection of _mapping items_ describing the correspondence between an user / group / any
object attribute and its counterpart on the Identity Store represented by the current external resource. Each item
specifies:

* internal attribute - the <<schema, schema>> acting as the source or destination of provisioning operations; it must be
specified by an expression matching one of the following models:
** `schema` - resolves to the attribute for the given `schema`, owned by the mapped entity (user, group, any object)
** `groups[groupName].schema` - resolves to the attribute for the given `schema`, owned by the group with name
`groupName`, if a membership for the mapped entity exists
** `anyObjects[anyObjectName].schema` - resolves to the attribute for the given `schema`, owned by the any object with
name `anyObjectName`, if a relationship with the mapped entity exists
** `memberships[groupName].schema` - resolves to the attribute for the given `schema`, owned by the membership for group
`groupName` of the mapped entity (user, any object), if such a membership exists
* external attribute - the name of the attribute on the Identity Store
* transformers - http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/[JEXL^] expression or Java class implementing
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/provisioning-api/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/provisioning/api/data/MappingItemTransformer.java[MappingItemTransformer^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/core/provisioning-api/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/provisioning/api/data/MappingItemTransformer.java[MappingItemTransformer^]
endif::[]
; the purpose is to transform values before they are sent to or received from the underlying connector
* mandatory condition - http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/[JEXL^] expression indicating whether values for 
this mapping item must be necessarily available or not; compared to a simple boolean value, such condition allows
complex statements to be expressed such as 'be mandatory only if this other attribute value is above 14', and so on
* remote key flag - should this item be considered as the key value on the Identity Store?
* password flag (Users only) - should this item be treated as the password value?
* purpose - should this item be considered for <<propagation,propagation>> / <<provisioning-push,push>>,
<<provisioning-pull,pull>>, both or none? 

Besides the items documented above, some more data needs to be specified for a complete mapping:

* ConnId `objectClass` - which
http://connid.tirasa.net/apidocs/1.4/org/identityconnectors/framework/common/objects/ObjectClass.html[object class^]
shall be used during communication with the Identity Store; predefined are `\\__ACCOUNT__` for Users and 
`\\__GROUP__` for Groups
* Object link - only required by some connector bundles as
https://connid.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BASE/LDAP[LDAP^] and
https://connid.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=360482[Active Directory^], generally specifies the model
for generating the DN (distinguished name) values

.Mapping items
====
The following mapping item binds the mandatory internal `name` schema with the external attribute `cn` for both 
propagation / push and pull.

[source,json]
----
{
  "key": "a2bf43c8-74cb-4250-92cf-fb8889409ac1",
  "intAttrName": "name",
  "extAttrName": "cn",
  "connObjectKey": true,
  "password": false,
  "mandatoryCondition": "true",
  "purpose": "BOTH"
}
----

The following mapping item binds the optional internal `aLong` schema for the membership of the `additional` group
with the external attribute `age` for propagation / push only; in addition, it specifies a JEXL expression which appends `.0`
to the selected `aLong` value before sending it out to the underlying connector.

[source,json]
----
{
  "key": "9dde8bd5-f158-499e-9d81-3d7fcf9ea1e8",
  "intAttrName": "memberships[additional].aLong",
  "extAttrName": "age",
  "connObjectKey": false,
  "password": false,

[[object-link-realms-hierarchy]]
[TIP]
.Object link and Realms hierarchy
====
When Object link is applicable - typically with LDAP or Active Directory, as said - the need may arise to map the Realms
hierarchy into nested structures, as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_unit_(computing)[Organizational Units^].

In such cases, the following JEXL expressions can be set for Object link (assuming `o=isp` is the root suffix), for
example, which leverage the `syncope:fullPath2Dn()` custom JEXL function:

* Realms: `syncope:fullPath2Dn(fullPath, 'ou') + ',o=isp'`
* Users: `'uid=' + name + syncope:fullPath2Dn(realm, 'ou', ',') + ',o=isp'`
* Groups: `'cn=' + name + syncope:fullPath2Dn(realm, 'ou', ',') + ',o=isp'`

[[connectors-resources-history]]
[NOTE]
.Connector Instances and External Resources Configuration History Management
====
When either developing an IdM solution or managing a production deployment, it often happens to play with
Connector Instances and / or External Resources configuration; sometimes, this results in failures which prevent
<<provisioning,provisioning>> to work properly.

In such situations it is possible to revert a Connector Instance's and / or External Resource's configuration to a
previous working state.

The maximum number of configurations to keep, for each Connector Instance and for each External Resource, is set by
`connector.conf.history.size` and `resource.conf.history.size`: see <<configuration-parameters, below>> for details.
