=== Implementations

It is possible to provide implementations suitable for <<customization-core,customization>> as:

. Java classes
. http://www.groovy-lang.org/[Apache Groovy^] classes

While the former shows some advantages about execution performance, the latter is extremely useful as it allows for
runtime updates, freeing from the hassle to redeploy when something needs to be changed.

[WARNING]
.With great power comes great responsibility
====
Customizing and extending the Core behavior by uploading a Groovy class via REST adds further flexibility to the
platform, allows to speed up the development cycle and can be used as Swiss army knife for maintenance and
administration.

Please beware that granting the permission to manage Implementations to non-admin users shall be performed with great
care. The Groovy code is anyway going to be executed in a sandbox, where the set of forbidden classes and methods
can be configured on each deployment. +
