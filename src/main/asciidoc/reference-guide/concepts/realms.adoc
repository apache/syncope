=== Realms

Realms define a hierarchical security domain tree, primarily meant for containing users, groups and
any objects.

Each realm:

. has a unique name and a parent realm - except for the pre-defined _root realm_, which is named `/`;
. is either leaf or root of a sub-tree of realms;
. is uniquely identified by the path from root realm, e.g. `/a/b/c` identifies the sub-realm `c` in the sub-tree rooted
at `b`, having in turn `a` as parent realm, directly under root realm;
. optionally refers to <<policies-account,account>> and <<policies-password,password>> policies: such policies are
enforced to all users, groups and any objects in the given realm and sub-realms, unless some sub-realms define their own.

If users, groups and any objects are member of a realm then they are also member of parent realm: as a result, the root
realm contains everything, and other realms can be seen as containers that split up the total number of entities into
smaller pools.

This has consequences on <<memberships-relationships,memberhips and relationships>>:

* An user or an any object can be member of groups in the same realm or in one of sub-realms.
* An user or an any object can be in relation with any objects in the same realm or in one of sub-realms.

Moreover, this partition allows fine-grained control over policy enforcement and, alongside with
<<entitlements,entitlements>> and <<roles,roles>>, contribute to implement
<<delegated-administration,delegated administration>>.

[TIP]
.Logic Templates
====
As with <<pull-templates,pull>> it is also possible to add templates to a realm.

The values specified in the template are applied to entities belonging to that realm, hence this can be used as
a mechanism for setting default values for attributes or external resources on entities.
====

==== Realm Provisioning
<<provisioning>> can be enabled for realms: <<mapping,mapping>> information can be provided so that realms
are considered during <<propagation,propagation>>, <<provisioning-pull,pull>> and <<provisioning-push,push>>.

Typical use cases for realm provisioning apply to modelization of organization-like structure on identity stores, as
with LDAP and Active Directory.

==== LogicActions

When users, groups or any objects get created, updated or deleted into a realm, custom logic can be invoked by
associating the given realm with one or more implementations of the
