==== Pull

Pull is the mechanism used to acquire identity data from identity repositories; for each external resource, one or more
<<tasks-pull,pull tasks>> can be defined, run and scheduled for period execution.

Pull task execution involves querying the external resource and then process each entity in an isolated transaction; 
a retrieved entity can be:

. _matching_ if a corresponding internal entity was found, according to the <<policies-pull,pull policy>> set for the
enclosing external resource;
. _unmatching_ otherwise.

Once assessed this, entities are processed according to the matching / unmatching rules specified for the pull task:
by default, unmatching entities gets internally created, and matching updated.

.Matching Rules
****
* `IGNORE`: do not perform any action;
* `UPDATE`: update matching entity;
* `DEPROVISION`: delete external entity;
* `UNLINK`: remove association with external resource, without performing any (de-)provisioning operation;
* `LINK`: associate with external resource, without performing any (de-)provisioning operation.
* `UNASSIGN`: unlink and delete;
****

.Unmatching Rules
****
* `IGNORE`: do not perform any action;
* `UNLINK`: do not perform any action;
* `ASSIGN`: create internally, assign the external resource;
* `PROVISION`: create internally, do not assign the external resource;
****

[TIP]
.Pull Mode
====
The identity repository can be queried in different ways, depending on the _pull mode_ specified:

****
FULL RECONCILIATION:: The complete list of entities available is processed.
FILTERED RECONCILIATION:: The subset matching the provided filter of all available entities is processed.
INCREMENTAL:: Only the actual modifications performed since last pull task execution are considered. This mode requires
the underlying connector bundle to implement the ConnId `SYNC` operation - only some of the available bundles match
this condition.
****

===== PullActions

The pull process can be decorated with custom logic to be invoked around task execution, by associating
pull tasks to one or more implementations of the
