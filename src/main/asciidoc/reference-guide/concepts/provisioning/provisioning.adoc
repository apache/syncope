=== Provisioning

As introduced <<provisioning-engines,above>>, provisioning is actually the core feature provided by Apache Syncope.

Essentially, it can be seen as the process of keeping the identity data, on Syncope and related external resources, 
synchronized according to the specifications provided by the <<mapping,mapping>> by performing create, update and
delete operations onto the <<persistence,internal storage>> or external resources via connectors.

==== Overview

The picture below contains an expanded view of the <<architecture,core architecture>>, with particular reference to the
components involved in the provisioning process.

The provisioning operations can be initiated in several different ways:

* by creating, updating or deleting users, groups or any objects via REST (thus involving the underlying 
<<logic,logic>> layer)
* by requesting execution of pull or push tasks via REST
* by triggering periodic pull or push task execution

==== Connectors and Resources

****
Connector Bundles:: The components able to connect to Identity Repositories; not specifically bound to Apache Syncope, 
as they are part of the http://connid.tirasa.net[ConnId^] project. Custom connectors can also be 
https://connid.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BASE/Create+new+connector[made from scratch^].
Connector Instances:: Instances of connector bundles, obtained by assigning values to the defined configuration 
properties. For instance, there is only a single `DatabaseTable` (the bundle) that can be instantiated
several times, for example if there is need to connect to different databases.
External Resources:: Meant to encapsulate all information about how Apache Syncope will use connector instances for 
provisioning. For each entity supported by the related connector bundle (user, group, printer, services, ...),
<<mapping,mapping>> information can be specified.
