=== Provisioning

As introduced <<provisioning-engines,above>>, provisioning is actually _the_ core feature provided by Apache Syncope.

Essentially, it can be seen as the process of keeping the identity data, on Syncope and related external resources, 
synchronized according to the specifications provided by the <<mapping,mapping>> by performing create, update and
delete operations onto the <<persistence,internal storage>> or external resources via connectors.

==== Overview

The picture below contains an expanded view of the <<architecture,core architecture>>, with particular reference to the
components involved in the provisioning process.

The provisioning operations can be initiated in several different ways:

* by creating, updating or deleting users, groups or any objects via REST (thus involving the underlying 
<<logic,logic>> layer)
* by requesting execution of pull or push tasks via REST
* by triggering periodic pull or push task execution
