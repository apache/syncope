=== Provisioning
The main purpose of identity management systems is to manage user and role provisioning.
User and role provisioning refers to the creation, maintenance, activation and deactivation of user and role objects
and their attributes. Provisioning operations can act on Apache Syncope only or be propagated towards external
resources as well.
The provisioning operation can be initiated by an authorized user (for instance, working on Apache Syncope
administration console) or by an internal task like a pull task.
A push task can be used to perform a bulk provisioning operation involving either Syncope and one
or more external resources.
