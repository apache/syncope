==== Push

With push, the matching set of internal entities can be sent to identity stores - mainly for
(re)initialization purposes; for each external resource, one or more <<tasks-push,push tasks>> can be defined, run and 
scheduled for period execution.

Push task execution involves querying the internal storage and then processing each entity in an isolated transaction; 
an internal entity can be:

. _matching_ if a corresponding remote entity was found, according to the <<policies-push,push policy>> set for the
enclosing external resource;
. _unmatching_ otherwise.

Once assessed this, entities are processed according to the matching / unmatching rules specified for the push task:
by default, unmatching entities are pushed to identity stores, and matching updated.

.Matching Rules
****
* `IGNORE`: do not perform any action;
* `UPDATE`: update matching entity;
* `DEPROVISION`: delete internal entity;
* `UNLINK`: remove association with external resource, without performing any (de-)provisioning operation;
* `LINK`: associate with external resource, without performing any (de-)provisioning operation.
* `UNASSIGN`: unlink and delete;
****

.Unmatching Rules
****
* `IGNORE`: do not perform any action;
* `UNLINK`: remove association with external resource, without performing any (de-)provisioning operation;
* `ASSIGN`: create externally, assign the external resource;
* `PROVISION`: create externally, do not assign the external resource;
****

===== PushActions

The push process can be decorated with custom logic to be invoked around task execution, by associating
push tasks to one or more implementations of the
