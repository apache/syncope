==== Propagation

Whenever a change is performed via REST on users, groups or any objects:

. a set of <<tasks-propagation,propagation tasks>> is generated, one for each associated external resource;
. the generated propagation tasks are executed, e.g. the corresponding operations (create, update or delete) are sent
out, via connectors, to the configured identity repositories; the tasks can be saved for later re-execution.

[TIP]
.Which external resources?
====
Depending on the entity being created / updated / deleted, different external resources are taken into account by the
propagation process:

* *group*: only the external resources directly assigned
* *user*: the external resources directly assigned plus the ones assigned to groups configured for the user
* *any object*: the external resources directly assigned plus the ones assigned to groups configured for the any object
====

By default, the propagation process is controlled by the
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/provisioning-java/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/provisioning/java/propagation/PriorityPropagationTaskExecutor.java[PriorityPropagationTaskExecutor^],

endif::[]
which implements the following logic:

* sort the tasks according to the related resource's _priority_, then execute sequentially
* tasks for resources with no priority are executed afterwards, concurrently
* the execution of a given set of tasks is halted (and global failure is reported) whenever the first sequential task
fails
* status and eventual error message (in case of no resource priority) can be saved for reporting, in case the related
external resource was configured with adequate tracing
* minimize the set of operations to be actually performed onto the identity store by attempting to read the external
object corresponding to the internal entity and comparing with the modifications provided

Different implementations of the
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/provisioning-api/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/provisioning/api/propagation/PropagationTaskExecutor.java[PropagationTaskExecutor^]

endif::[]
interface can be provided, in case the required behavior does not fit into the provided implementation.

===== PropagationActions

The propagation process can be decorated with custom logic to be invoked around task execution, by associating
external resources to one or more implementations of the
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/provisioning-api/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/provisioning/api/propagation/PropagationActions.java[PropagationActions^]

interface.

Some examples are included by default, see table below.
