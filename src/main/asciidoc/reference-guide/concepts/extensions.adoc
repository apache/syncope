=== Extensions

The _vanilla_ Apache Syncope deployment can be optional enriched with useful features via an Extension, instead of bloating
every single deployment with unneeded libraries and configurations.

With reference to <<architecture,architecture>>, an extension might add a <<rest>> endpoint, manage the
<<persistence,persistence>> of additional entities, extend the <<security,security>> mechanisms, tweak the
<<provisioning-layer,provisioning layer>>, add features to the <<admin-console-component>> or
the <<enduser-component>>, or even bring all such things together.

Extensions are available from different sources:

. as Maven artifacts published from the Apache Syncope codebase, part of the official releases - this is the case of the
ones detailed below;
. as Maven artifacts published by third parties;
. as part of a given deployment source code, as explained <<customization-extensions, in the following>>.

==== Apache Camel Provisioning Manager

This extension delegates the <<provisioning,provisioning>> process execution to a set of
http://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel^] routes.

The pre-loaded routes can be dynamically changed at runtime via REST or admin console, and modifications are immediately
made available for processing.

For example, on creating a new user, you may wish to send an email to an administrator; or if a user is
reactivated, you may wish to reactivate the user's home page on a web server. +
All these things and more are possible using the myriad of
http://camel.apache.org/components.html[components^] that are available to be used in Apache Camel routes.

==== Swagger

This extension enables http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI^] as web interface for dealing with Apache Syncope
<<rest,RESTful>> services.

Once installed, Swagger UI is available at

....
protocol://host:port/syncope/swagger/
....

where `protocol`, `host` and `port` reflect your Java EE container installation.

==== SAML 2.0 Service Provider

This extension can be leveraged to provide
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language[SAML 2.0^]-based
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on[Single Sign-On^] access to the <<admin-console-component>>,
the <<enduser-component>> or any other Java EE application dealing with the <<core>>.

Once installed, one or more https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider[Identity Providers^] can be imported from
their https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0#SAML_2.0_Metadata[metadata^].
For each Identity Provider, it is to configure which one of the attributes - returned as part of the assertion
containing the attribute statements - is going to be used by Syncope to match the internal users.

This extension adds features to all components and layers that are available, and can be taken as reference when creating
<<customization-extensions,new extensions>>.
