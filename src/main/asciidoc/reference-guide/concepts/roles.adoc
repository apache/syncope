=== Roles

Roles map set of <<entitlements,entitlements>> to set of <<realms,realms>>.

[TIP]
.Static and Dynamic Memberships
====
Users are _statically_ assigned to roles when assignments are explicitely set.

With role definition, however, a condition can be expressed so that all matching users are _dynamic_ members of the
role.
====

==== Delegated Administration

The idea is that any user U assigned to a role R, which provides entitlements E~1~...E~n~ for realms Re~1~...Re~k~ can 
exercise E~i~ on entities (users, groups, any objects of given types, depending on E~i~) under any Re~j~ or related
sub-realms.

.Authorization
====
Let's suppose that we want to implement the following scenario:

****
Administrator A can create users under realm R~5~ but not under realm R~7~, administrator B can update users under 
realm R~6~ and R~8~, administrator C can update groups under realm R~8~.
****

As by default, Apache Syncope will have defined the following entitlements, among others:

* `USER_CREATE`
* `USER_UPDATE`
* `GROUP_UPDATE`

Hence, here is how entitlements should be assigned (via roles) to administrators in order to implement the scenario 
above:

* Administrator A: `USER_CREATE` on R~5~
* Administrator B: `USER_UPDATE` on R~6~ and R~8~
* Administrator C: `GROUP_UPDATE` on R~8~
====

[NOTE]
.Group Ownership
====
Groups can designate user or another group as _owner_.

The practical consequence of this setting is that users owning a group (either because they are directly set as owners
or members of the owning group) is that they are entitled to perform all operations (create, update, delete, ...) on the
owned group, regardless of the realm.
