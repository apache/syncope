=== Policies

Policies control different aspects of the <<provisioning,provisioning>> process and can be used to fine-tune and adapt
the overall mechanism to the particularities of the spefic domain in which a given Apache Syncope deployment is running.

[[policy-composition]]
[TIP]
.Policy Composition
====
When defining policies and associating to different realms and resources, it is common to observe that several policies
of the same kind have to be enforced to the same user, group or any object.

In such cases, Apache Syncope transparently composes all the candidate policies and obtains a single applicable policy
which contains all conditions of the composing policies; this process, however, is not guaranteed to be successful,
as different policies of the same kind might provide conflicting clauses.
====

[[policies-account]]
==== Account

Account policies allow to impose constraints on username values, and are involved in the authentication process.

[NOTE]
====
When set for realm R, an account policy is enforced to all users of R and sub-realms.

When set for resource R, an account policy is enforced to all users that have R assigned.
====

When defining an account policy, the following information is to be provided:

* max authentication attempts - how many times users are allowed to fail authentication before getting suspended
* propagate suspension - when suspended as consequence of too many authentication failures, should users also be
suspended on associated resources or not?
* pass-through resources - which <<external-resource-details,external resources>> are involved with
<<pass-through-authentication,pass-through authentication>>
* rules - set of account rules to evaluate with the current policy

===== Account Rules

Account rules define constraints to apply to username values.

===== Pass-through Authentication

During user authentication, if the <<policy-composition,resulting>> account policy to apply defines pass-through
resources, the provided credentials are verified prior against the internal storage then against each configured
external resource (provided that the underlying <<connector-instance-details,connector instance>> has the `AUTHENTICATE`
capability set): the first check succeeding will successfully authenticate the user.

This feature allows, for example, to avoid storing password values in the internal storage and to reuse credentials
contained in identity stores (with no need of pulling them out), or to implement authentication chains.

[[policies-password]]
==== Password

Password policies allow to impose constraints on password values.

[NOTE]
====
When set for realm R, a password policy is enforced to all users of R and sub-realms.

When set for resource R, a password policy is enforced to all users that have R assigned.
====

When defining a password policy, the following information is to be provided:

* allow null password - whether password is mandatory for users or not
* history length - how many values shall be considered in the history
* rules - set of password rules to evaluate with the current policy

Password rules define constraints to apply to password values.

[[policies-pull]]
==== Pull

Pull policies are evaluated during the execution of <<tasks-pull,pull tasks>> and are meant to:

. help matching existing users, groups and any objects during <<provisioning-pull,pull>>, thus generating update events
(rathern than create)
. determine which action shall be taken in case such match is not unique (e.g. what to do if the same external account
can be mapped to two distinct users in Apache Syncope?)

[NOTE]
====
When set for resource R, a pull policy is enforced to all users, groups and any objects pulled from R.
====

When defining a pull policy, the following information is to be provided:

* conflict resolution action
** `IGNORE` - do nothing
** `FIRSTMATCH` - pull first matching object only
** `LASTMATCH` - pull last matching object only
** `ALL` - pull all matching objects
* rules - set of correlation rules to evaluate with the current policy; for each defined <<anytype,any type>>, a
different rule is required

===== Pull Correlation Rules

Pull correlation rules define how to match objects received from <<connector-instance-details,connector instances>>
with existing users, groups or any objects.
