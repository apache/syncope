=== Workflow

Workflow manages the internal identity lifecycle by defining statuses and transitions that every user, group or any
object in Apache Syncope will traverse. A workflow instance is started once identities get created, and shut down when
removed.

Workflow is triggered during the <<provisioning,provisioning>> process as first step to create, update or delete
identities into the internal storage.

[NOTE]
.Workflow Adapters
====
The workflow features are defined by the workflow adapter interfaces:

Custom adapters can be provided by implementing the related interfaces, also as bridges towards third-party tools as 
https://camunda.org/[Camunda^] or http://jbpm.jboss.org/[jBPM^].

==== Activiti User Workflow Adapter

An advanced adapter is provided for users, based on http://www.activiti.org/[Activiti BPM^], the reference open source 
http://www.bpmn.org/[BPMN 2.0^] implementation.

is bootstrapped from

and presents several advantages and more features, if compared to the default user adapter:

. Besides mandatory statuses, which are modeled as BPMN `userTask` instances, more can be freely added
at runtime, provided that adequate transitions and conditions are also inserted; more details about available BPMN
constructs in the http://www.activiti.org/userguide/index.html#bpmnConstructs[Activiti User Guide^]. +
Additional statuses and transitions allow the internal processes of Apache Syncope to better adapt to suit organizational flows.
. Custom logic can be injected into the workflow process by providing BPMN `serviceTask` instances.
. http://www.activiti.org/userguide/index.html#forms[Activiti forms^] are used for implementing <<approval,approval>>.
. The http://www.activiti.org/userguide/index.html#activitiModeler[Activiti Modeler^] can be enabled in the
<<admin-console,admin console>>, thus allowing web-based graphical modeling of the workflow definition.

===== Approval

Every transition in the Activiti user workflow definition can be subjected to approval.

The underlying idea is that some kind of self-modifications (group memberships, external resource assignments, ...)
might not be allowed to 'plain' users, as there could be conditions which require management approval.
Managers could also be asked for completing the information provided before the requested operation is completed.

In order to define an approval form, a dedicated BPMN `userTask` needs to be defined, following the rules established
for http://www.activiti.org/userguide/index.html#forms[Activiti forms^].

[[sample-selfreg-approval]]
.Approving self-registration
====
The snippet below shows how to define an approval form in XML; the same operation can be performed via the
http://www.activiti.org/userguide/index.html#activitiModeler[Activiti Modeler^].

[source,xml]
----
<userTask id="createApproval" name="Create approval"
          activiti:candidateGroups="managingDirector" activiti:formKey="createApproval"> // <1>
  <extensionElements>
    <activiti:formProperty id="username" name="Username" type="string"
                           expression="${user.username}" writable="false"/> // <2>
    <activiti:formProperty id="approve" name="Approve?" type="boolean"
                           variable="approve" required="true"/> // <3>
    <activiti:formProperty id="rejectReason" name="Reason for rejecting" type="string"
                           variable="rejectReason"/>
  </extensionElements>
</userTask>
----
<1> `formKey` and `id` must be unique across the workflow definition, `name` is displayed by the admin console;
`candidateGroups` and `candidateUsers` might be defined, even both, to indicate which groups or users should be
managing these approvals
<2> `expression` will be evaluated against the current requesting `user` (as workflow variable) and related properties;
read-only form input can be defined by setting `writable="false"`
<3> exporting approval inputs into workflow variables is possible via the `variable` attribute; required form input can
be defined by setting `required="true"`
====

Once the form is defined, any modification subject to that approval will be manageable via admin console, according to
the following flow (the actual operations on admin console for the sample above are reported <<console-approval,below>>):

. administrator A sees the new approval notifications +
. administrator A claims the approval and is then allowed to manage it
. administrator A reviews the updated user, with ongoing modification applied (no actual modification performed yet)
. administrator A can approve or reject such modification
