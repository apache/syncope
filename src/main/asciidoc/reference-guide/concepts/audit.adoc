=== Audit

The audit feature allows to capture <<audit-events,events>> occurring within the <<core>> and to log relevant information
about them. +
By default, events are logged as entries into the `AuditEntry` table of the internal storage. +
Audit events can also be processed differently, for example when using the <<elasticsearch>> extension.

Once events are reported, they can be used as input for external tools.

[TIP]
====
An example of how audit entries can be extracted for reporting is shown by the <<audit-reportlet>>.

==== Audit Events

The information provided for <<notification-events,notification events>> is also valid for audit events, including examples -
except for the admin console <<console-configuration-audit,tooling>>, which is naturally distinct.

==== Audit Appenders

In addition to default processing, events are also available for custom handling via Audit
Appenders, based on https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/appenders.html[Apache Log4j 2 Appenders^]. +
This allows to empower the available implementations or to write new ones in order to route audit messages, with optional
transformation (rewrite), to files, queues, sockets, syslog, etc.

Custom implementations must follow the
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/idrepo/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/audit/AuditAppender.java[AuditAppender^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/core/idrepo/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/audit/AuditAppender.java[AuditAppender^]
endif::[]
interface.

Some convenience implementations are provided, meant to serve as reference - see table below.

| This requires to specify (a) a set of events to which the appender is bound (log only if one of such events occurs)
and (b) a target appender, e.g. one of https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/appenders.html[Apache Log4j 2 Appenders^]
or a custom implementation.

implementation, which allows to rewrite the original audit message into something more suitable to the target
destination.
