=== Entitlements

Entitlements are basically strings describing the right to perform an operation on Syncope.

The components in the <<logic,logic layer>> are annotated with
http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/[Spring Security^] to implement declarative security; in the following
code snippet taken from
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/RealmLogic.java[RealmLogic^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/2_1_X/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/RealmLogic.java[RealmLogic^]
endif::[]
, the
http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.2.x/reference/htmlsingle/#el-common-built-in[`hasRole` expression^]
is used together with one of the standard entitlements to restrict access only to Users owning the `REALM_LIST`
entitlement.

[source,java]
----
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('" + StandardEntitlement.REALM_LIST + "')")
public List<RealmTO> list(final String fullPath) {
----

Entitlements are granted via <<roles, roles>> to Users, scoped under certain <<realms,realms>>, thus allowing
<<delegated-administration,delegated administration>>.

[WARNING]
====
The set of available entitlements is
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/types/StandardEntitlement.java[statically defined^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/2_1_X/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/types/StandardEntitlement.java[statically defined^]
endif::[]
- even though <<extensions,extensions>> have the ability to
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion/ext/camel/common-lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/types/CamelEntitlement.java[enlarge the initial list^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/2_1_X/ext/camel/common-lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/types/CamelEntitlement.java[enlarge the initial list^]
endif::[]
: this is because entitlements are the pillars of the internal security model and are not meant for external usage.

If you need to model the rights that Users own on external applications, look at <<privileges,privileges>>, instead.
