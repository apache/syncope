=== Routes

Routes represents the main configuration to instruct <<secure-remote-access,SRA>> to respond to HTTP requests.

Every route is defined by providing the following information:

. name - unique reference to the current route
. target - base URI to proxy requests for
. error URI - where to redirect in case of errors
. type - `PUBLIC` or `PROTECTED`: the latter requires authentication against the configured Access Manager
. logout - whether to proceed with logout against the configured Access Manager
. post-logout URI - where to redirect after logging out
. CSRF - whether protection against https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery[Cross-Site Request Forgery]
shall be applied to incoming requests
. order - value to sort routes for evaluation
. predicates - composed condition, supporting logic operators as `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`, to specify if incoming requests
shall match the owning route
. filters - ordered list of elements allowing to perform modification of the incoming request and / or outgoing response

When an HTTP request is received, SRA evaluates all the configured _predicates_, sorted by their owning _route_'s _order_,
to determine the first matching route among the ones defined.

If the matching route has _type_ `PROTECTED`, the configured Access Manager is involved to authorize the request; while
<<web-access,WA>> works out-of-the-box, others can be configured, provided that they implement standard protocols as
OpenID Connect or SAML.

The incoming request is then pre-processed by matching route's _filters_ and sent to the configured _target_. +
The received response, after being post-processed by matching route's _filters_, is finally returned to the initial caller.

==== Predicates

Inside Route definition, each predicate will be referring to some Spring Cloud Gateway's 
https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/reference/spring-cloud-gateway/request-predicates-factories.html[Predicate factory^]:

   * `AFTER` matches requests that happen after the specified datetime;
   * `BEFORE` matches requests that happen before the specified datetime;
   * `BETWEEN` matches requests that happen after first datetime and before second datetime;
   * `COOKIE` matches cookies that have the given name and whose values match the regular expression;
   * `HEADER` matches with a header that has the given name whose value matches the regular expression;
   * `HOST` matches the `Host` header;
   * `METHOD` matches the provided HTTP method(s);
   * `PATH` matches the request path;
   * `QUERY` matches the query string;
   * `REMOTE_ADDR` matches the caller IP address;
   * `WEIGHT` matches according to the weights provided per group of target URIs;
   * `CUSTOM` matches according to a provided class extending

==== Filters

Inside Route definition, each filter will be referring to some Spring Cloud Gateway's 
https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/reference/spring-cloud-gateway/gatewayfilter-factories.html[Filter factory^]:

   * `ADD_REQUEST_HEADER` adds a header to the downstream request's headers;
   * `ADD_REQUEST_PARAMETER` adds a parameter too the downstream request's query string;
   * `ADD_RESPONSE_HEADER` adds a header to the downstream response’s headers;
   * `CLIENT_CERTS_TO_REQUEST_HEADER` takes SSL certificates associated with the request to downstream request's headers;
   * `DEDUPE_RESPONSE_HEADER` removes duplicate values of response headers;
   * `FALLBACK_HEADERS` after an execution exception occurs, the request is forwarded to a fallback endpoint; the
headers with the exception type, message and (if available) root cause exception type and message are added to that
request;
   * `LINK_REWRITE` rewrites HTTP links in the response body before it is sent back to the client;
   * `MAP_REQUEST_HEADER` creates a new named header with the value extracted out of an existing named header from
the incoming request;
   * `PREFIX_PATH` will prefix a part to the path of the incoming request;
   * `PRESERVE_HOST_HEADER` sets a request attribute that the routing filter inspects to determine if the original host
header should be sent, rather than the host header determined by the HTTP client;
   * `PRINCIPAL_TO_REQUEST_HEADER` takes authenticated principal to downstream request's headers;
   * `QUERY_PARAM_TO_REQUEST_HEADER` takes incoming query params to downstream request's headers;
   * `REDIRECT_TO` will send a HTTP status `30x` with a `Location` header to perform a redirect;
   * `REMOVE_REQUEST_HEADER` removes a header to the downstream request's headers;
   * `REMOVE_RESPONSE_HEADER` removes a header to the downstream response’s headers;
   * `REQUEST_HEADER_TO_REQUEST_URI` changes the request URI by a request header;
   * `REQUEST_RATE_LIMITER` determines if the current request is allowed to proceed: if it is not, a HTTP status `429`
is returned;
   * `RETRY` attempts to connect to downstream request's target for the given number of retries before giving up;
   * `REWRITE_PATH` uses regular expressions to rewrite the request path;
   * `REWRITE_LOCATION` modifies the value of the `Location` response header;
   * `REWRITE_RESPONSE_HEADER` modifies the value of response header;
   * `SECURE_HEADERS` adds a number of recommended security headers to the response;
   * `SAVE_SESSION` forces to save the current HTTP session before forwarding the call downstream;
   * `SET_PATH` manipulates the request path;
   * `SET_REQUEST_HEADER` replaces a header to the downstream request's headers;
   * `SET_RESPONSE_HEADER` replaces a header to the downstream response’s headers;
   * `SET_STATUS` sets HTTP status to return to caller;
   * `SET_REQUEST_SIZE` restricts a request from reaching the downstream service;
   * `SET_REQUEST_HOST` sets host header to the downstream request's headers;
   * `STRIP_PREFIX` removes parts from the path of the incoming request;
   * `CUSTOM` will manipulate downstream request or response according to a provided class extending
