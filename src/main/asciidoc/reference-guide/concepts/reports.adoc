=== Reports

Reports are a powerful tool to extract, filter and format relevant information from a running Apache Syncope deployment,
for a wide range of purposes: from business to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps[DevOps^].

When defining a report, the following information must be provided:

* mime type and file extension: the type of content that the report is expected to generate
* job delegate class: Java class extending
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/provisioning-java/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/provisioning/java/job/report/AbstractReportJobDelegate.java[AbstractReportJobDelegate^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/3_0_X/core/provisioning-java/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/provisioning/java/job/report/AbstractReportJobDelegate.java[AbstractReportJobDelegate^]
endif::[]
providing the custom logic to extract information from Syncope and generate output according to the configured mime type
* scheduling information:
