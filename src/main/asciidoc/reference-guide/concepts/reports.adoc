=== Reports

Reports are a powerful tool to extract, filter and format relevant information from a running Apache Syncope deployment,
for a wide range of purposes: from business to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps[DevOps^].

A report is essentially defined by a <<report-templates,template>> and a sequence of <<reportlets,reportlets>>, where
the latter is responsible for extracting the required information and the former defines how execution results will be
presented, in the various available formats.

Reports can be executed upon request or scheduled: execution results can be downloaded as:

* XML
* HTML
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format[PDF^]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format[RTF^]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values[CSV^]

==== Report Templates

A report template is defined as a triple of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT[XSLT^] documents, distinguished by their
target format:

* `FO` - transforms the given report result as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSL_Formatting_Objects[XSL-FO], which
will be then made available as PDF and RTF
* `HTML` - outputs the given report result as HTML
* `CSV` - outputs the given report result as CSV

[NOTE]
====
Report templates can be easily managed either via the <<console-reports,admin console>>, the <<eclipse-ide-plugin>> or
the <<netbeans-ide-plugin>>.

==== Reportlets

Reportlets are the building blocks of reports.

Each reportlet is composed by:

* a Java class extending
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/report/AbstractReportlet.java[AbstractReportlet^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/report/AbstractReportlet.java[AbstractReportlet^]
endif::[]
and implementing the information extraction logic and generating an XML stream as result
* a Java class extending
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/report/AbstractReportletConf.java[AbstractReportletConf^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/report/AbstractReportletConf.java[AbstractReportletConf^]
endif::[]
and embedding the configuration options that can be tuned when incorporating a given reportlet into a report; when
properly annotated, such options are manageable via the <<console-reports,admin console>>

Some reportlets are available by default (and briefly presented below) either for direct usage or for acting as
a reference when building new reportlets for specific Apache Syncope deployments.

===== Static Reportlet

Defined by
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/report/StaticReportlet.java[StaticReportlet^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/report/StaticReportlet.java[StaticReportlet^]
endif::[]
and
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/report/StaticReportletConf.java[StaticReportletConf^],
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/report/StaticReportletConf.java[StaticReportletConf^],
endif::[]
it is essentially a handy way to inject static values (of various types) into a report.

===== User and Group Reportlets
Defined by
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/report/UserReportlet.java[UserReportlet^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/report/UserReportlet.java[UserReportlet^]
endif::[]
and
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/report/UserReportletConf.java[UserReportletConf^],
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/report/UserReportletConf.java[UserReportletConf^],
endif::[]
it can be used to report various information about Users available in the internal storage, their attributes,
memberships and relationships, external resources and so on.

A similar reportlet is also available for Groups, defined by
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/report/GroupReportlet.java[GroupReportlet^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/report/GroupReportlet.java[GroupReportlet^]
endif::[]
and
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/report/GroupReportletConf.java[GroupReportletConf^].
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/report/GroupReportletConf.java[GroupReportletConf^].
endif::[]

===== Reconciliation Reportlet

Defined by
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/report/ReconciliationReportlet.java[ReconciliationReportlet^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/report/ReconciliationReportlet.java[ReconciliationReportlet^]
endif::[]
and
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/report/ReconciliationReportletConf.java[ReconciliationReportletConf^],
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/report/ReconciliationReportletConf.java[ReconciliationReportletConf^],
endif::[]
it provides the global reconciliation status for all Users, Groups and Any Objects available in the internal storage,
e.g. whether such entities are available on all Identity Stores matching the assigned
<<external-resources,external resources>> and, if so, whether the <<mapping,mapped>> attributes feature the expected
values.

An instance of reconciliation reportlet is run by default from the admin console's <<dashboard,dashboard>>, and results
are available as a widget.

===== Audit Reportlet

Defined by
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/report/AuditReportlet.java[AuditReportlet^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/core/logic/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/logic/report/AuditReportlet.java[AuditReportlet^]
endif::[]
and
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/report/AuditReportletConf.java[AuditReportletConf^],
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/master/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/report/AuditReportletConf.java[AuditReportletConf^],
endif::[]
it is mostly a sample reportlet showing how to extract data produced by <<audit>>.
