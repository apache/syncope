==== Access Managers
As briefly mentioned before, in general an access manager is not an identity manager. An access management software
manages above all the authentication on a given environment. It provides the methods, generally called authentication
module, to manage the user authentication, the latter based on various identification systems as the password,
the fingerprint or based on various protocols as SAML and OAuth 2.0.
