==== Identity Stores
An identity store is the place where digital identities are stored. Of course there are various store types, the most
famous are:

* Microsoft Active Directory;
* LDAP
** OpenLDAP;
** FreeIPA;
** ForgeRock OpenDJ;
** 389 Directory Server;
* DBMS
** MySQL
** PostgreSQL
** Oracle

From Apache Syncope point of view, an identity store is viewed as an integrated resource with a communication based
on the identity connectors.
