=== Identity Technologies

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is not implemented by a single technology; it is instead a composition of
heterogeneous technologies - differing by maturity, scope, applicability and feature coverage - which require some
'glue' to fit together.

As with other application domains, it can be observed that tools that appeared earlier tend to partially overlap with more 
recent, targeted products.
