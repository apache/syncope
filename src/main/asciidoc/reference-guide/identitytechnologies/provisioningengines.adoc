==== Provisioning Engines

The main role of _Provisioning Engines_ is to keep Identity Stores as much synchronized as possible.

Some other characteristics and features provided:

* Adapt to identity store data and application models
* Do not require changes in identity stores or applications
* Build virtual unified view of identity data distributed across several identity stores
* Allow to define and enforce security policies
* Permit workflow definition, with transitions subject to approval
* Focused on application back-end

In brief, provisioning engines take heterogeneous identity stores (and business requirements) as input and build up
high-level identity data management throughout what is called the *Identity Lifecycle*.

Technologically, *Apache Syncope* is primarily a *Provisioning Engine*.
