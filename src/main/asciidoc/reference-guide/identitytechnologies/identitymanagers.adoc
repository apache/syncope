==== Identity Managers

The main role of _Identity Managers_ is to keep Identity Stores synchronized as much as possible.

Some other characteristics and features provided:

* Adapt to Identity Store data and application models
* Do not require changes in Identity Stores or applications
* Build virtual unified view of identity data distributed across several Identity Stores
* Allow to define and enforce security policies
* Permit workflow definition, with transitions subject to approval
* Focused on application back-end

In brief, Identity Managers take heterogeneous Identity Stores (and business requirements) as input and build up
high-level identity data management throughout what is called the *Identity Lifecycle*.

[NOTE]
====
Applications can typically integrate with Identity Managers by:

* exposing some sort of provisioning API (often via REST or SOAP) being invoked by Identity Managers - also called
_native integration_;
* having their identity repository externally managed by Identity Managers - also called _legacy integration_.
