==== RESTful reference
If you want to read from the complete descriptive REST reference the URL you need is
[source]
--
http://localhost:9080/syncope/
--
where you can see all the REST resources with their description, the parameters and the reference to the schema, 
so you are able to see which attributes and which type are needed to the every service.
Following the same example as before, below two images to show the REST resources of the logger service and another one 
for the reference to the schema:

===== Swagger UI
From the 2.0 version, Syncope offers also the Swagger UI to work with its services.

The Swagger installation is really simple because you just add the Maven dependency to your core pom.xml file generated
from the archetype operation; the dependency is:
[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.syncope.ext</groupId>
  <artifactId>syncope-ext-swagger-ui</artifactId>
  <version>${syncope.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The swagger interface is available going to the URL
[source]
--
http://localhost:9080/syncope/swagger/#/
--

Reading from the Swagger http://swagger.io/[website]

.Swagger
****
Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API. With the largest ecosystem of API tooling on 
the planet, thousands of developers are supporting Swagger in almost every modern programming language and deployment 
environment. With a Swagger-enabled API, you get interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability.

We created Swagger to help fulfill the promise of APIs. Swagger helps companies like Apigee, Getty Images, Intuit, 
LivingSocial, McKesson, Microsoft, Morningstar, and PayPal build the best possible services with RESTful APIs.

Now in version 2.0, Swagger is more enabling than ever. And it's 100% open source software.

To be consistent with the example, below the image shows the Swagger UI used to read the configuration 
of _org.apache.syncope.core.rest_
