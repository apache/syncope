==== RESTful reference
If you want to read from the complete descriptive REST reference the URL you need is
[source]
--
http://localhost:9080/syncope/
--
where you can see all the REST resources with their description, the parameters and the reference to the schema, 
so you are able to see which attributes and which type are needed to the every service.
Following the same example as before, below two images to show the REST resources of the logger service and another one 
for the reference to the schema:

image::restReferenceLoggerRead.png[restReferenceLoggerRead]

image::restReferenceLoggerUpdate.png[restReferenceLoggerUpdate]

image::restSchemaReferenceLogger.png[restSchemaReferenceLogger]
