=== Enduser Application
Once the Java EE container has initialized, the enduser application can be accessed at:

....
protocol://host:port/syncope-enduser/
....

where `protocol`, `host` and `port` reflect your Java EE container installation.

The scope of the enduser application is primarily to provide a dedicated web-based entry-point for self-registration,
self-service and <<password-reset,password reset>>.

Usually, organizations thend to require deep customizations not only in the appearance but often also in the actual
mechanisms behind, in order to best suit their processes and flows. +
This is the main reason why the enduser application is composed of an
https://angularjs.org/[AngularJS^] frontend - which eases extension and full customization - featured by an
http://wicket.apache.org[Apache Wicket^] backend - which proxies access to the <<core>>, thus skipping several security
concerns at a glance.

Nonetheless, the introduction of a client-side technology as AngularJS brought some important security issues to
attention; above all, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery[CRSF^] /
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery[XSRF^] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot[BOT^]
attacks. +
The enduser application offers protection mechanisms against all of them, and optionally consent to embed external
features as https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html[Google re-Captcha^].

While full-fledged front-end features are provided, it is important to highlight how these are primarily meant for
<<customization-enduser,customization>> on a given deployment.
