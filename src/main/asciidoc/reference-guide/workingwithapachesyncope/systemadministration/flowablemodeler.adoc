==== Enable the Flowable Modeler

Due to licensing issues - see
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYNCOPE-439?focusedCommentId=13829896&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13829896[this comment^]
for more information - it is not possible to embed the
http://www.flowable.org/docs/userguide/index.html#flowableModelerApp[Flowable Modeler^], which provides a powerful
graphical web editing interface for Flowable, into any Apache Syncope artifact; thus, some manual steps are required to enable it on a
working Apache Syncope deployment, for use with the Admin Console.

[WARNING]
This procedure requires Apache Maven since it is using a fake project to perform all of the required setup tasks.

First of all, generate a new Maven project as described in the
ifeval::["{backend}" == "html5"]
http://syncope.apache.org/docs/getting-started.html[Apache Syncope Getting Started Guide,]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{backend}" == "pdf"]
http://syncope.apache.org/docs/getting-started.pdf[Apache Syncope Getting Started Guide,]
endif::[]
then build via

....
$ mvn -P all clean install
....

At this point, copy the `console/target/flowable-modeler/` directory in the desired location of the host where the
admin console is deployed, then set the value of `flowableModelerDirectory` with this path in the `console.properties`
file.
