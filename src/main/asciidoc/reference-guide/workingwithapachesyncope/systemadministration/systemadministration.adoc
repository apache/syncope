.Where are the configuration files?
****
Depending on which Apache Syncope distribution you are running, the configuration files mentioned in the following
text might reside in different locations.

Standalone:: Assuming that `$CATALINA_HOME` is the Apache Tomcat base directory created when the distribution archive
was unzipped, the configuration files are located under

* `$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/syncope/WEB-INF/classes/`
* `$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/syncope-console/WEB-INF/classes/`
* `$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/syncope-enduser/WEB-INF/classes/`

Debian packages:: The configuration files will be first searched in `/etc/apache-syncope`, then under

* `/usr/share/tomcat8/webapps/syncope/WEB-INF/classes/`
* `/usr/share/tomcat8/webapps/syncope-console/WEB-INF/classes/`
* `/usr/share/tomcat8/webapps/syncope-enduser/WEB-INF/classes/`

GUI installer:: Assuming that `$CONF_DIRECTORY` is the directory selected from the installer, the configuration files will be first
searched in `$CONF_DIRECTORY`, then under the selected Java EE container's application classpath.

Maven project:: Assuming that `$CONF_DIRECTORY` is the directory passed among
<<deployment-directories,deployment directories>> at build time and that `$SOURCE` is the path where the Maven project
was generated, the configuration files will be first searched in
`$CONF_DIRECTORY`, then under the selected Java EE container's application classpath, according to the content of

* `$SOURCE/core/target/classes/`
* `$SOURCE/console/target/classes/`
* `$SOURCE/enduser/target/classes/`
