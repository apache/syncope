==== Configuration Parameters

Most run-time configuration options are available as parameters and can be tuned either via the admin console, CLI or
barely invoking the REST layer through http://curl.haxx.se/[curl^]:

* `password.cipher.algorithm` - which cipher algorithm shall be used for encrypting password values; supported 
algorithms include `SHA-1`, `SHA-256`, `SHA-512`, `AES`, `S-MD5`, `S-SHA-1`, `S-SHA-256`, `S-SHA-512` and `BCRYPT`;
salting options are available in the `security.properties` file;
* `notificationjob.cronExpression` -
http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.2.x/tutorials/crontrigger.html[cron^] expression describing how
frequently the pending <<tasks-notification,notification tasks>> are processed: empty means disabled;
* `notification.maxRetries` - how many times the delivery of a given notification should be attempted before giving up;
* `token.length` - the length of the random tokens that can be generated as part of various <<workflow,workflow>>
processes, including <<password-reset,password reset>>;
* `token.expireTime` - the time after which the generated random tokens expire;
* `selfRegistration.allowed` - whether self-registration (typically via the enduser application) is allowed;
* `passwordReset.allowed` - whether the <<password-reset,password reset>> feature (typically via the enduser
application) is allowed;
* `passwordReset.securityQuestion` - whether the <<password-reset,password reset>> feature involves security questions;
* `authentication.statuses` - the list of <<workflow,workflow>> statuses for which users are allowed to authenticate;
* `log.lastlogindate` - whether the system updates the `lastLoginDate` field of users upon authentication;
* `tasks.interruptMaxRetries` - how many attempts shall be made when interrupting a running <<task,task>>;
* `return.password.value` - whether the hashed password value shall be returned when reading users;
* `identity.recertification.day.interval` - Number of days bewteen identity recertifications.
Besides this default set, new configuration parameters can be defined to support <<customization,custom>> code.
