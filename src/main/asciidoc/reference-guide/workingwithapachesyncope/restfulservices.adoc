=== RESTful services

All the features provided by the <<core>> are available as RESTful services.

The base URL for invoking such services is normally set as

....
protocol://host:port/syncope/rest/
....

where `protocol`, `host` and `port` reflect your Java EE container installation.

[NOTE]
.REST Reference
====
A complete REST reference generated from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language[WADL^] is
http://syncope.apache.org/rest/2.0/index.html[published^] as well as made available with each deployment at

....
protocol://host:port/syncope/
....

where `protocol`, `host` and `port` reflect your Java EE container installation.
====

[TIP]
The <<swagger,Swagger extension>> might also help greatly when working with RESTful services.

==== REST Authentication and Authorization

The <<core>> authentication and authorization is based on http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/[Spring Security^].

As an initial step, authentication is required to obtain, in the `X-Syncope-Token` HTTP header, the
unique signed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token[JSON Web Token^] to include in all subsequent requests.

By providing the token received in the initial exchange, the requester can be identified and checked for authorization,
based on owned <<entitlements,entitlements>>.

[NOTE]
Users can examine their own entitlements looking at the `<<x-syncope-entitlements,X-Syncope-Entitlements>>`
header value, and their own privileges looking at the `<<x-syncope-privileges,X-Syncope-Privileges>>` header value.

[TIP]
====
The relevant security configuration lies in
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/spring/src/main/resources/securityContext.xml[securityContext.xml^];
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/2_1_X/core/spring/src/main/resources/securityContext.xml[securityContext.xml^];
endif::[]
while normally not needed, this configuration can be anyway customized via the <<override-behavior,override behavior>>.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication[HTTP Basic Authentication] is set for use by default.
====

===== JWTSSOProvider

Besides validating and accepting the JSON Web Tokens generated during the authentication process as sketched above,
Apache Syncope can be enabled to cope with tokens generated by third parties, by providing implementations of the
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/spring/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/spring/security/JWTSSOProvider.java[JWTSSOProvider^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/tree/2_1_X/core/spring/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/core/spring/security/JWTSSOProvider.java[JWTSSOProvider^]
endif::[]
interface.

[[authorization-summary]]
.Authorization Summary
****
The set of RESTful services provided by Apache Syncope can be divided as:

. endpoints accessible without any sort of authentication (e.g. truly anonymous), for self-registration and
<<password-reset,password reset>>;
. endpoints disclosing information about the given Syncope deployment (available <<schema,schema>>, configured
<<extensions,extensions>>, Groups, ...), requiring some sort of shared authentication defined by the
`anonymousKey` value  in the `security.properties` file - for more information, read about Spring Security's
http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.2.x/reference/htmlsingle/#anonymous[Anonymous Authentication^];
. endpoints for self-service (self-update, password change, ...), requiring user authentication and no entitlements;
. endpoints for administrative operations, requiring user authentication with authorization granted by the related
<<entitlements,entitlements>>, handed over to users via <<roles,roles>>.
****

==== REST Headers

Apache Syncope supports a number of HTTP headers as detailed below, in addition to the common HTTP headers such as
`Accept`, `Content-Type`, etc.

[TIP]
It is possible to deal with the headers below when using the <<client-library>> via the `SyncopeClient` class methods.

===== X-Syncope-Token

`X-Syncope-Token` is returned on response to <<rest-authentication-and-authorization,successful authentication>>, and
contains the unique signed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token[JSON Web Token^] identifying the authenticated
user.

The value returned for the `X-Syncope-Token` header must be included in all subsequent requests, in order for the
requester to be checked for authorization, as part of the standard https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750[Bearer^]
`Authorization` header.

.Obtaining JWT with http://curl.haxx.se/[curl^] 
====
....
curl -I -u admin:password -X POST http://localhost:9080/syncope/rest/accessTokens/login
....
returns
....
HTTP/1.1 204 
X-Syncope-Token: eyJ0e..
....
which can then be used to make a call to the REST API
.....
curl -I -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0e.." http://localhost:9080/syncope/rest/users/self
.....
====

The token duration can be configured via the `jwt.lifetime.minutes` property - see
<<configuration-parameters, below>> for details.

===== X-Syncope-Domain

`X-Syncope-Domain` can be optionally set for requests (when not set, `Master` is assumed) to select the target
<<domains,domain>>. +
The value for this header is provided in all responses.

===== X-Syncope-Key and Location

When creating an entity (User, Group, Schema, External Resource, ...) these two headers are populated respectively with
the entity key (which may be auto-generated) and the absolute URI identifying the new REST resource.

===== X-Application-Error-Code and X-Application-Error-Info

If the requested operation is in error, `X-Application-Error-Code` will contain the error code (mostly from
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/types/ClientExceptionType.java[ClientExceptionType^])
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/2_1_X/common/lib/src/main/java/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/types/ClientExceptionType.java[ClientExceptionType^])
endif::[]
and `X-Application-Error-Info` might be optionally populated with more details, if available.

===== X-Syncope-Null-Priority-Async

When set to `true`, this request header instructs the <<propagation,propagation process>> not to wait for completion
when communicating with <<external-resource-details,External Resources>> with no priority set.

===== Prefer and Preference-Applied

Some REST endpoints - typically for creating, updating or deleting Users, Groups or Any Objects - return the
entity in the response payload by default. +
If this is not required, the `Prefer` request header can be set to `return-no-content` (`return-content` will instead
keep the default behavior).

When `Prefer` is specified in the request, the response will feature the `Preference-Applied` header, with value set
to the effective preference applied.

[TIP]
Use `Prefer` in scenarios where it is important to avoid unnecessary data in the response payload.

===== ETag, If-Match and If-None-Match

For each response containing Users, Groups or Any Objects, the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag[ETag^] header is
generated, which contains the latest modification date.

This value can be passed, during subsequent requests to modify the same entity, via the `If-Match` or
`If-None-Match` headers. +
When the provided `If-Match` value does not match the latest modification date of the entity, an error is reported and
the requested operation is not performed.

[TIP]
The combined usage of `ETag` and `If-Match` can be enforced to implement optimistic concurrency control over Users,
Groups and Any Objects operations.

===== X-Syncope-Entitlements

When invoking the REST endpoint `/users/self` in `GET`, the `X-Syncope-Entitlements` response header will list all
the <<entitlements,entitlements>> owned by the requesting user.

===== X-Syncope-Privileges

When invoking the REST endpoint `/users/self` in `GET`, the `X-Syncope-Privileges` response header will list all
the <<privileges,privileges>> owned by the requesting user.

==== Bulk Operations

Some REST endpoints feature the _bulk mode_, e.g. the capability to perform a given operation onto several items at the
same time.

The table below shows the bulk operations available.

[cols="1,5a"]
|===

|Any Objects
| * `DELETE` - remove several any objects at once

|Groups
| * `PROVISION` - provision all members of the given group onto all the associated external resources
 * `DEPROVISION` - deprovision all members of the given group from all the associated external resources
 * `DELETE` - remove several groups at once

|Users
| * `SUSPEND` - suspend several users at once
* `REACTIVATE` - set several users at once back to the active state
* `MUSTCHANGEPASSWORD` - force several users at once to change their passwords
* `DELETE` - remove several users at once

| Tasks
| * `DRYRUN` - executes several tasks at once, with the <<dryrun>> option set
* `EXECUTE` - executes several tasks at once
* `DELETE` - remove several tasks at once

| External Resources
| * `DEPROVISION` - delete several users, groups or any objects at once from an external resource but keep in the
internal storage and leave the external resource associated
 * `UNLINK` - remove the association between several users, groups or any objects at once and an external resource,
without performing any deprovisioning operation
 * `UNASSIGN` - unlink and deprovision several users, groups or any objects at once from an external resource
|===

==== Search

It is possible to search for Users, Groups and Any Objects matching a set of given conditions expressed through
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-rs-search.html#JAX-RSSearch-FeedItemQueryLanguage[FIQL^].

The https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-atompub-fiql-00[Feed Item Query Language^] (FIQL, pronounced “fickle”)
is a simple but flexible, URI-friendly syntax for expressing filters across the entries in a syndicated feed.

The FIQL queries can be passed (among other parameters) to the search endpoints available, e.g.

* `GET /users?fiql=query`
* `GET /groups?fiql=query`
* `GET /anyObjects?fiql=query`

where `query` is an URL-encoded string representation of the given FIQL query, as in the following examples.

.Simple attribute match
====
----
username==rossini
----
====

.Wildcard attribute match
====
----
username==*ini
----
====

.Case-insensitive attribute match
====
----
username=~rOsSiNi
----
====

.Case-insensitive wildcard attribute match
====
----
username=~*iNi
----
====

.Null attribute match
====
----
loginDate==$null
----
====

.Date attribute comparison
====
----
lastLoginDate=ge=2016-03-02 15:21:22
----
====

.Resource assignment match
====
----
$resources==resource-ldap
----
====

.Group membership match (only for Users and Any Objects)
====
----
$groups==root
----
====

.Role membership match (only for Users)
====
----
$roles==Other
----
====

.Type match (only for Any Objects)
====
----
$type==PRINTER
----
====

.Complex match (featuring logical AND and OR)
====
----
username=~*iNi;(loginDate==$null,$roles==Other)
----
====

===== Sorting Search Results

Search results can be requested for sorting by passing the optional `orderBy` query parameter to the search endpoints
available, e.g.

* `GET /users?fiql=query&orderBy=sort`
* `GET /groups?fiql=query&orderBy=sort`
* `GET /anyObjects?fiql=query&orderBy=sort`

where `sort` is an URL-encoded string representation of the sort request, as in the following examples.

.Single attribute sort, default direction (`ASC`)
====
----
username
----
====

.Single attribute sort, with direction
====
----
username DESC
----
====

.Multiple attribute sort, with directions
====
----
email DESC, username ASC
----
====

==== Client Library

The Java client library simplifies the interaction with the <<core>> by hiding the underlying HTTP
communication details and providing native methods and payload objects.

The library is available as a Maven artifact:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.syncope.client</groupId>
  <artifactId>syncope-client-lib</artifactId>
  <version>{docVersion}</version>
</dependency>
----

ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]

[WARNING]
====
Do not forget to add the following repository to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<repository>
  <id>ASF</id>
  <url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
  <snapshots>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
  </snapshots>
</repository>
----
====

endif::[]

[discrete]
===== Initialization

First you need to build an instance of `SyncopeClientFactoryBean` by providing the deployment base URL, as follows:

[source,java]
----
SyncopeClientFactoryBean clientFactory = new SyncopeClientFactoryBean().
              setAddress("http://localhost:9080/syncope/rest/");
----

You might also select a specific <<domains,domain>> - other than `Master`, choose to exchange XML payloads - rather
than JSON (default), or to select 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_compression[HTTP compression^] (more options in the
http://syncope.apache.org/apidocs/2.0/org/apache/syncope/client/lib/SyncopeClientFactoryBean.html[Javadoc^]):

[source,java]
----
SyncopeClientFactoryBean clientFactory = new SyncopeClientFactoryBean().
              setAddress("http://localhost:9080/syncope/rest/").
              setDomain("Two").
              setContentType(SyncopeClientFactoryBean.ContentType.XML).
              setUseCompression(true);
----

At this point an instance of `SyncopeClient` can be obtained by passing the login credentials via:

[source,java]
----
SyncopeClient client = clientFactory.create("admin", "password");
----

Or you can combine into a single statement as:

[source,java]
----
SyncopeClient client = new SyncopeClientFactoryBean().
              setAddress("http://localhost:9080/syncope/rest/").
              create("admin", "password");
----

[discrete]
===== Usage

Select one of the
http://syncope.apache.org/apidocs/2.0/org/apache/syncope/common/rest/api/service/package-summary.html[RESTful services^]
and invoke one of the available methods:

[source,java]
----
LoggerService loggerService = client.getService(LoggerService.class);

LoggerTO loggerTO = loggerService.read(LoggerType.LOG, "org.apache.syncope.core.connid");
loggerTO.setLevel(LoggerLevel.DEBUG);

loggerService.update(LoggerType.LOG, loggerTO);
----

[NOTE]
More RESTful services could be available besides the 
http://syncope.apache.org/apidocs/2.0/org/apache/syncope/common/rest/api/service/package-summary.html[default set^],
as there might be <<extensions,extensions>> installed in the given deployment; the
<<apache-camel-provisioning-manager>> provides the
http://syncope.apache.org/apidocs/2.0/org/apache/syncope/common/rest/api/service/CamelRouteService.html[CamelRouteService^],
for instance.

[TIP]
Advanced REST features are also available from `SyncopeClient` instances: check
http://syncope.apache.org/apidocs/2.0/org/apache/syncope/client/lib/SyncopeClient.html[the javadoc^]
for more information.

.Search for Users, Groups or Any Objects
====
All search operations return
http://syncope.apache.org/apidocs/2.0/org/apache/syncope/common/lib/to/PagedResult.html[paged result handlers^]
which can be exploited both for getting the actual results and for extrapolating pagination coordinates.

[source,java]
----
UserService userService = client.getService(UserService.class);

int count = userService.search(new AnyQuery.Builder().page(0).size(0).build()).getTotalCount(); // <1>

PagedResult<UserTO> matchingUsers = userService.search(

    build()); // <5>

GroupService groupService = client.getService(GroupService.class);

PagedResult<GroupTO> matchingGroups = groupService.search(
    new AnyQuery.Builder().realm("/even/two").page(3).size(150).
    fiql(SyncopeClient.getGroupSearchConditionBuilder().isAssignable().
        and("name").equalTo("palo*").query()).
    build()); // <6>
----
<1> get the total number of users available in the given deployment (and <<domains,domain>>)
<2> get users in the root realm with username matching the provided wildcard expression
<3> get users in the root realm with no values for `loginDate`, i.e. that have never authenticated to the
