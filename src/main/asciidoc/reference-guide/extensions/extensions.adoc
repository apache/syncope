.Swagger
****
Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API. With the largest ecosystem of API tooling on 
the planet, thousands of developers are supporting Swagger in almost every modern programming language and deployment 
environment. With a Swagger-enabled API, you get interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability.

We created Swagger to help fulfill the promise of APIs. Swagger helps companies like Apigee, Getty Images, Intuit, 
LivingSocial, McKesson, Microsoft, Morningstar, and PayPal build the best possible services with RESTful APIs.

Now in version 2.0, Swagger is more enabling than ever. And it's 100% open source software.

To be consistent with the example, below the image shows the Swagger UI used to read the configuration 
of _org.apache.syncope.core.rest_
