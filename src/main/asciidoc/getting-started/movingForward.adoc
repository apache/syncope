== Moving Forward

Once you have obtained a working installation of Apache Syncope using one of the methods reported above, you should consider 
reading the
ifeval::["{backend}" == "html5"]

endif::[]
ifeval::["{backend}" == "pdf"]
https://syncope.apache.org/docs/reference-guide.pdf[Apache Syncope Reference Guide.]
endif::[]
to understand how to configure, extend, customize and deploy your new Apache Syncope project.

Before deploying your Apache Syncope installation into production, it is essential to ensure that the default values for 
various security properties have been changed to values specific to your deployment. 

The following values must be changed from the defaults in the `core.properties` file:

* *adminPassword* - The cleartext password as encoded per the `adminPasswordAlgorithm` value (`SSHA256` by default), the
default value of which is "password".
* *secretKey* - The secret key value used for AES ciphering; AES is used by the use cases below:
  ** if the value for `adminPasswordAlgorithm` is `AES` or the configuration parameter `password.cipher.algorithm` is
changed to `AES`
  ** if set for Encrypted Plain Schema instances
  ** for Linked Accounts' password values
  ** to securely store Access Token's cached authorities
  ** within some of the predefined rules used by Password Policies
* *anonymousKey* - The key value to use for anonymous requests.
* *jwsKey* - The symmetric signing key used to sign access tokens. See section 4.4.1 "REST Authentication and 
Authorization" of the Reference Guide for more information.

Note that if you installed Syncope using the maven archetype method, then you will have already supplied custom values
for `secretKey`, `anonymousKey` and `jwsKey`.
