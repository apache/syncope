== Obtain Apache Syncope

There are several ways to obtain Apache Syncope: each of which has advantages or caveats for different types of users.

=== Standalone

The standalone distribution is the simplest way to start exploring Apache Syncope: it contains a fully working, in-memory
Tomcat-based environment that can be easily grabbed and put at work on any modern laptop, workstation or server. 

[CAUTION]
.Target Audience
First approach, especially with administration console and end-user; does not require technical skills. +
*Not meant for any production environment.*

Getting ready in a few easy steps:

. http://syncope.apache.org/downloads.html[download^] the standalone distribution
. unzip the distribution archive
. go into the created Apache Tomcat directory
. start Apache Tomcat
* GNU / Linux, Mac OS X
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chmod 755 ./bin/*.sh
$ ./bin/startup.sh
----
+
* Windows
+
[source,dos]
----
> bin/startup.bat
----

[TIP]
Please refer to the http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/[Apache Tomcat documentation^] for more advanced setup and 
instructions.

[[standalone-components]]
==== Components

The set of provided components, including access URLs and credentials, is the same as reported for 
<<paths-and-components,embedded mode>>, with the exception of log files, available here under `$CATALINA_HOME/logs`.

[TIP]
.Internal Storage
====
By default, the standalone distribution is configured to use an in-memory database instance.
This means that every time Tomcat is shut down all changes that have been made are lost.

If you want instead to make your changes persistent, replace

[source,java]
jdbc:h2:mem:syncopedb;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1

with

[source,java]
jdbc:h2:~/syncopedb;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1

in `webapps/syncope/WEB-INF/classes/domains/Master.properties` (for `Master` domain) or
`webapps/syncope/WEB-INF/classes/domains/Two.properties` (for `Two` domain) from the Apache Tomcat directory.
This will create H2 database files in the home directory of the user running Apache Syncope.

Please refer to the http://www.h2database.com/[H2 documentation^] for more options.
====

=== Debian packages

Debian packages are available for use with http://www.debian.org/[Debian GNU / Linux^], 
http://www.ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu^] and their derivatives. 

[CAUTION]
.Target Audience
Getting up and running quickly on Debian / Ubuntu. +
*Difficult to extend beyond pre-sets.*

Download::
http://syncope.apache.org/downloads.html[Download^] the latest .deb packages

Prepare::
. Install Apache Tomcat 8
+
[source,bash]
sudo apt-get install tomcat8
+
[WARNING]
*Ubuntu LTS 14.04 LTS* does not provide the tomcat8 package by default: you will need instead to download and manually
install the following packages (from Ubuntu 15.04):

. Use the PostgreSQL JDBC driver with Tomcat
+
[source,bash]
sudo ln -s /usr/share/java/postgresql-jdbc4.jar /usr/share/tomcat8/lib/
+
. Replace `JAVA_OPTS` in `/etc/default/tomcat8` with the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.awt.headless=true -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -server \
  -Xms1536m -Xmx1536m -XX:NewSize=256m -XX:MaxNewSize=256m \
  -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:+DisableExplicitGC"
----
+
Install::
. Stop Tomcat
+
[source,bash]
sudo service tomcat8 stop
+
. Install Apache Syncope core, console and enduser via the downloaded packages
+
[source,bash]
sudo dpkg -i apache-syncope-*.deb
+
. Create a database for use with Apache Syncope
+
[source,bash]
sudo SYNCOPE_USER="syncope" SYNCOPE_PASS="syncope" sh /usr/share/apache-syncope/dbinit-postgresql.sh
+
. Start Tomcat
+
[source,bash]

=== Maven Project

This is the *preferred method* for working with Apache Syncope, giving access to the whole set of customization
and extension capabilities.

[CAUTION]
.Target Audience
Provides access to the full capabilities of Apache Syncope, and almost all extensions that are possible. +
*Requires Apache Maven (and potentially https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps[DevOps^]) skills.*

[[maven-prerequisites]]
==== Prerequisites

 . http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven^] (version 3.0.3 or higher) installed
 . Some basic knowledge about Maven
 . Some basic knowledge about http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[Maven archetypes^].

==== Create project

Maven archetypes are templates of projects. Maven can generate a new project from such a template. 
In the folder in which the new project folder should be created, type the command shown below. 
On Windows, run the command on a single line and leave out the line continuation characters ('\').

ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]

[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.syncope \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=syncope-archetype \
    -DarchetypeRepository=http://repo1.maven.org/maven2 \
    -DarchetypeVersion={docVersion}
----

endif::[]

ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]

[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:2.4:generate \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.syncope \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=syncope-archetype \
    -DarchetypeRepository=http://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots \
    -DarchetypeVersion={docVersion}
----

[WARNING]
====
Once the Maven project is generated, add the following right before `</project>` in the root `pom.xml` of the 
generated project:

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>apache.snapshots</id>
    <url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>
----
====

endif::[]

The archetype is configured with default values for all required properties; if you want to customize any of these 
property values, type 'n' when prompted for confirmation.

You will be asked for:

groupId::
    something like 'com.mycompany'
artifactId::
    something like 'myproject'
version number::
    You can use the default; it is good practice to have 'SNAPSHOT' in the version number during development and the 
maven release plugin makes use of that string. But ensure to comply with the desired numbering scheme for your project.
package name::
    The java package name. A folder structure according to this name will be generated automatically; by default, equal 
to the groupId.
secretKey::
    Provide any pseudo-random string here that will be used in the generated project for AES ciphering.
anonymousKey:: 
    Provide any pseudo-random string here that will be used as an authentication key for anonymous requests.

Maven will create a project for you (in a newly created directory named after the value of the `artifactId` property 
specified above) containing four modules: `common`, `core`, `console` and `enduser`.

You are now able to perform the first build via

[source,bash]
mvn clean install

After downloading all of the needed dependencies, three WAR files will be produced:

. `core/target/syncope.war`
. `console/target/syncope-console.war`
. `enduser/target/syncope-enduser.war`

If no failures are encountered, your basic Apache Syncope project is now ready to go.

[NOTE]
====
Before actual deployment onto a standalone Java EE container, you need to further check the **Customization** chapter of
the
ifeval::["{backend}" == "html5"]
http://syncope.apache.org/docs/reference-guide.html[Apache Syncope Reference Guide]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{backend}" == "pdf"]
http://syncope.apache.org/docs/reference-guide.pdf[Apache Syncope Reference Guide]
endif::[]
====

==== Embedded Mode

Every Apache Syncope project has the ability to run a full-blown in-memory environment, particularly useful either when
evaluating the product and during the development phase of an IdM solution.

[WARNING]
====
Don't forget that this environment is completely in-memory: this means that every time Maven is stopped, all changes 
made are lost.
====

From the top-level directory of your project, execute:

[source,bash]
mvn -P all clean install

then, from the `enduser` subdirectory, execute:

[source,bash]
mvn -P embedded

=== CLI

The command-line interface (CLI) client is an utility tool meant for interacting with Apache Syncope deployments from
shell scripts.

Once downloaded and uncompressed, you will find a `lib` directory and two scripts: `syncopeadm.sh` and `syncopeadm.bat`,
which will be used depending on the operating system.

The installation process creates `cli.properties`, which contains all the required information to invoke the Apache 
Syncope REST API services.
The file content looks like the following:

....
syncope.rest.services=http://localhost:9080/syncope/rest
syncope.admin.user=admin
syncope.admin.password=QePSFVTnzwQowM4ohhaUYcE6aW47MVZ/
....

where:

syncope.rest.services::
    the base URL where the Apache Syncope REST API services are listening;
syncope.admin.user::
    the username which will be used to invoke the Syncope APIs;
syncope.admin.password::
    the password for the admin user configured above.

As shown above, the password value is encrypted for security reasons.

[[cli-installation]]
==== Installation
After the file is unzipped you can start with CLI client using the `syncopeadm` file.
If you have tried to run a CLI command before the installation process, the script will return
[source]
--
 - Error: It seems you need to first setup the CLI client. Run install --setup.
--

So, as suggested, you have to run the install command to use the CLI:
[source]
--
$ ./syncopeadm.sh install --setup
--

A successful result will be:
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----

You are running: install --setup

    the context where the rest services are deployed (/syncope/rest is the default);
Syncope admin user::
    the user with the permission to call the Syncope APIs;
Syncope admin password::
    the user password.

==== Troubleshooting
Various error messages are possible on installation. Here are some sample error messages:

===== Syncope unreachable (or wrong address):

[source]
--

Provided address: http://localhost:9080/syncope/rest

###############################################
#                                             #
#       Provided address is unreachable!      #
#         Check it and if it is wrong         #
#        START the installation AGAIN!        #
#                                             #
