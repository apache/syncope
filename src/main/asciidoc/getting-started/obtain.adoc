== Obtain Apache Syncope

There are several ways to obtain Apache Syncope: each of which has advantages or caveats for different types of users.

=== Standalone

The standalone distribution is the simplest way to start exploring Apache Syncope: it contains a fully working, in-memory
Tomcat-based environment that can be easily grabbed and put at work on any modern laptop, workstation or server. 

[CAUTION]
.Target Audience
First approach, especially with Admin and End-user UIs; does not require technical skills. +
*Not meant for any production environment.*

Getting ready in a few easy steps:

. https://syncope.apache.org/downloads[download^] the standalone distribution
. unzip the distribution archive
. go into the created Apache Tomcat directory
. start Apache Tomcat
* GNU / Linux, Mac OS X
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chmod 755 ./bin/*.sh
$ ./bin/startup.sh
----
+
* Windows
+
[source,dos]
----
> bin/startup.bat
----

[TIP]
Please refer to the http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/[Apache Tomcat documentation^] for more advanced setup and 
instructions.

[[standalone-components]]
==== Components

The set of provided components, including access URLs and credentials, is the same as reported for 
<<paths-and-components,embedded mode>>, with the exception of log files, available here under `$CATALINA_HOME/logs`.

[TIP]
.Internal Storage
====
By default, the standalone distribution is configured to use an in-memory database instance.
This means that every time Tomcat is shut down all changes that have been made are lost.

If you want instead to make your changes persistent, replace

[source,java]
jdbc:h2:mem:syncopedb;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1

with

[source,java]
jdbc:h2:~/syncopedb;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1

in `webapps/syncope/WEB-INF/classes/core-embedded.properties` for `persistence.domain[0].jdbcURL` property (`Master`
domain) and / or

[source,java]
jdbc:h2:mem:syncopetwo;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1

with

[source,java]
jdbc:h2:~/syncopetwo;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1

for `persistence.domain[1].jdbcURL` property (`Two` domain), from the Apache Tomcat directory.
This will create H2 database files in the home directory of the user running Apache Syncope.

Please refer to the http://www.h2database.com/[H2 documentation^] for more options.
====

=== Docker

https://www.docker.com/[Docker^] images ready to use, published to https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub^].

[CAUTION]
.Target Audience
Getting up and running quickly on Docker. +
*All configurations available to set, difficult customizations.*

[WARNING]
Working with these images requires to have Docker correctly installed and configured.

[TIP]
The Docker images can be used with orchestration tools as
https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose^] or https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes^].

==== Docker images

All images share a commong set of environment variables:

* `KEYMASTER_ADDRESS`: Keymaster address
* `KEYMASTER_USERNAME`: username for Keymaster authentication
* `KEYMASTER_PASSWORD`: password for Keymaster authentication
* `SERVICE_DISCOVERY_ADDRESS`: address to publish to Keymaster for the current instance
* `ANONYMOUS_USER`: username for service-to-service authentication
* `ANONYMOUS_KEY`: password for service-to-service authentication

===== Core

Apache Syncope Core, see <<a-birds-eye-view-on-the-architecture,above>> for information.

Port exposed: `8080`.

Environment variables:

* `DB_URL`: JDBC URL of internal storage
* `DB_USER`: username for internal storage authentication
* `DB_PASSWORD`: password for internal storage authentication
* `DB_POOL_MAX`: internal storage connection pool: ceiling
* `DB_POOL_MIN`: internal storage connection pool: floor
* `OPENJPA_REMOTE_COMMIT`: configure multiple instances, with high availability; valid values are the ones accepted by
OpenJPA for
http://openjpa.apache.org/builds/3.1.2/apache-openjpa/docs/ref_guide_event.html[remote event notification^] including
`sjvm` (single instance)

===== Console

Apache Syncope Admin UI, see <<a-birds-eye-view-on-the-architecture,above>> for information.

===== Enduser

Apache Syncope Enduser UI, see <<a-birds-eye-view-on-the-architecture,above>> for information.

Port exposed: `8080`.

===== WA

Apache Syncope Web Access, see <<a-birds-eye-view-on-the-architecture,above>> for information.

Port exposed: `8080`.

Environment variables:

* `CAS_SERVER_NAME`: public base URL to reach this instance; in case of clustered setup, this is the public-facing
address and not the individual node address

===== SRA

Apache Syncope Secure Remote Access, see <<a-birds-eye-view-on-the-architecture,above>> for information.

Port exposed: `8080`.

==== Docker Compose samples

Besides the ones reported below, more samples are

.Core, Admin UI and Enduser UI with PostgreSQL, with embedded Keymaster
====
The `docker-compose.yml` below will create and connect 4 Docker containers to provide an IdM-only, single
instance, Apache Syncope deployment. All referenced images are available on Docker Hub.

[NOTE]
In this sample we are configuring an embedded, REST-based Keymaster hence `KEYMASTER_USERNAME` / `KEYMASTER_PASSWORD`
are passed with same values as `ANONYMOUS_USER` / `ANONYMOUS_KEY`.

===== How to start the containers

. Save the example file locally.
. Download and start the containers:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml up
----

The following services will be available:

[cols="1,2"]
|===

| REST API reference
| http://localhost:18080/syncope/

| Admin UI
| http://localhost:28080/syncope-console/ +
Credentials: `admin` / `password`

| End-user UI
| http://localhost:38080/syncope-enduser/

| WA (only with Example 2)
| http://localhost:48080/syncope-wa/

| SRA (only with Example 2)
| http://localhost:58080/

==== Kubernetes sample

A set of example https://www.helm.sh/[Helm^] charts is
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/tree/syncope-{docVersion}/docker/src/main/resources/kubernetes[available^],
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/tree/master/docker/src/main/resources/kubernetes[available^],
endif::[]
that can be used to install Apache Syncope directly in Kubernetes.

Some assumptions are made:

* a working Kubernetes Cluster to install into - if not available, follow this
https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/[tutorial^]
[NOTE]
Any other cloud provider or local install (e.g. AWS, Minikube, OpenShift) can be used

* Helm installed - follow these https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/[instructions^] if you don't

* allow for https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/[dynamic provisioning^] of persistent
volumes - otherwise you will need to manually create the volume

The install process is broken into two separate Helm charts; this is due to the fact that Apache Syncope doesn't startup
properly if the database used as internal storage is not fully initialized yet:

* `postgres` chart; this will install the PostgreSQL database and configure a persistent volume and persistent volume
claim to store the data
* `syncope` chart; this is the actual Apache Syncope install, which will deploy three separate pods
(Core, Console, and Enduser)

image::SyncopeLayoutInK8s.png[]

The installation steps are:

. Open a terminal and navigate to the `kubernetes`
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/tree/syncope-{docVersion}/docker/src/main/resources/kubernetes[folder^],
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/tree/master/docker/src/main/resources/kubernetes[folder^],
endif::[]
wherever you downloaded it

. Set your actual values in `postgres/values.yaml`

. Install PostgreSQL
+
[source,bash]
----
helm install postgres --name postgres --namespace <YOUR_NAMESPACE> -f postgres/values.yaml
----
+
Wait until PostgreSQL is initialized (watch logs for confirmation)

. Set your actual values in `syncope/values.yaml`

. Install Apache Syncope
+
[source,bash]
----
helm install syncope --name syncope --namespace <YOUR_NAMESPACE> -f syncope/values.yaml
----

=== Maven Project

This is the *preferred method* for working with Apache Syncope, giving access to the whole set of customization
and extension capabilities.

[CAUTION]
.Target Audience
Provides access to the full capabilities of Apache Syncope, and almost all extensions that are possible. +
*Requires Apache Maven (and potentially https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps[DevOps^]) skills.*

[[maven-prerequisites]]
==== Prerequisites

 . http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven^] (version 3.5.0 or higher) installed
 . Some basic knowledge about Maven
 . Some basic knowledge about http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[Maven archetypes^].

==== Create project

Maven archetypes are templates of projects. Maven can generate a new project from such a template. 
In the folder in which the new project folder should be created, type the command shown below. 
On Windows, run the command on a single line and leave out the line continuation characters ('\').

ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]

[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ mvn archetype:generate \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.syncope \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=syncope-archetype \
    -DarchetypeRepository=https://repo1.maven.org/maven2 \
    -DarchetypeVersion={docVersion}
----

endif::[]

ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]

[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:2.4:generate \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.syncope \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=syncope-archetype \
    -DarchetypeRepository=https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots \
    -DarchetypeVersion={docVersion}
----

[WARNING]
====
Once the Maven project is generated, add the following right before `</project>` in the root `pom.xml` of the 
generated project:

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>apache.snapshots</id>
    <url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>
----
====

endif::[]

The archetype is configured with default values for all required properties; if you want to customize any of these 
property values, type 'n' when prompted for confirmation.

You will be asked for:

groupId::
    something like 'com.mycompany'
artifactId::
    something like 'myproject'
version number::
    You can use the default; it is good practice to have 'SNAPSHOT' in the version number during development and the 
maven release plugin makes use of that string. But ensure to comply with the desired numbering scheme for your project.
package name::
    The java package name. A folder structure according to this name will be generated automatically; by default, equal 
to the groupId.
secretKey::
    Provide any pseudo-random string here that will be used in the generated project for AES ciphering.
anonymousKey:: 
    Provide any pseudo-random string here that will be used as an authentication key for anonymous requests.

Maven will create a project for you (in a newly created directory named after the value of the `artifactId` property 
specified above) containing seven modules: `common`, `core`, `console`, `enduser`, `wa`, `sra` and `fit`.

You are now able to perform the first build via

[source,bash]
$ mvn clean install

After downloading all of the needed dependencies, the following artifacts will be produced:

. `core/target/syncope.war`
. `console/target/syncope-console.war`
. `enduser/target/syncope-enduser.war`
. `wa/target/syncope-wa.war`
. `sra/target/syncope-sra.jar`

If no failures are encountered, your basic Apache Syncope project is now ready to go.

[NOTE]
====
Before actual deployment as executbale or onto a Java EE container, you need to further check the **Customization**
chapter of the
ifeval::["{backend}" == "html5"]
https://syncope.apache.org/docs/reference-guide.html[Apache Syncope Reference Guide.]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{backend}" == "pdf"]
https://syncope.apache.org/docs/reference-guide.pdf[Apache Syncope Reference Guide.]
endif::[]
====

==== Embedded Mode

Every Apache Syncope project has the ability to run a full-blown in-memory environment, particularly useful either when
evaluating the product and during the development phase of an IdM solution.

[WARNING]
====
Don't forget that this environment is completely in-memory: this means that every time Maven is stopped, all changes 
made are lost.
====

From the top-level directory of your project, execute:

[source,bash]
$ mvn -P all clean install

[WARNING]
====
The switch `-P all` is used here in order to build with all extensions available, with paths and settings
configured for the embedded mode.

When building for production, instead, it is recommended to check the **Customization** chapter of
the
ifeval::["{backend}" == "html5"]
https://syncope.apache.org/docs/reference-guide.html[Apache Syncope Reference Guide.]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{backend}" == "pdf"]
https://syncope.apache.org/docs/reference-guide.pdf[Apache Syncope Reference Guide.]
endif::[]
====

then, from the `fit` subdirectory, execute:

[source,bash]
$ mvn -P embedded,all
