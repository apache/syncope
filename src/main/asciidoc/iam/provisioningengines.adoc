=== Provisioning Engines
A provisioning engine is a software able to execute some operation on the profile of a digital identity.
Precisely this operation could be run to manage a user life circle, the _CRUD_ operation to persist the user on an
identity store:

* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

or could be the operations able to modify the user profile in order to activate or deactivate its digital identity, or
could be the operations to add or remove a role from an user profile to achieve the RBAC (Role-based access control)
in an environment and so on. Definitely a provisioning engine manages the digital identity user profile in a centralized
way.
