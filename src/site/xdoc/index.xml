        <span style="font-weight: bold">Apache Syncope</span>
        is an Open Source system for managing digital identities in enterprise environments, 
        implemented in Java EE technology and released under Apache 2.0 license.
      </p>

      <p>
        Often, <span style="font-weight: bold">Identity Management</span> and
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Access Management</span> are jointly referred, mainly because their two
        management worlds likely coexist in the same project or in the same environment.<br/>
        The two topics are however completely different: each one has its own context, its own rules, its own best
        practices.<br/>
        On the other hand, some products provide unorthodox implementations so it is indeed possible to do the same
        thing with both of them.

    <dl>
      <dt>Identity Management</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Tools and practices to keep identity data consistent and synchronized across repositories, data formats and
          models.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Access Management</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Systems, protocols and technologies supporting user authentication (how Users are let accessing a given
          system) and authorization (which capabilities each user owns on a given system).</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
      
    <p>From the definitions above, Identity Management and Access Management can be seen as complementary: very often,
      the data synchronized by the former are then used by the latter to provide its features - e.g. authentication
      and authorization.</p>
