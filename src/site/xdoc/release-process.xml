      <p>The Syncope team is using the 
        <a href="http://repository.apache.org">Apache Nexus repository</a> for releasing SNAPSHOT and release artifacts.
        More details on releasing artifacts and using Nexus can be found on the Maven website at
        <a href="http://maven.apache.org/developers/release/apache-release.html">http://maven.apache.org/developers/release/apache-release.html</a>.

        Install/Configure 
        <code>GPG</code> - The artifacts that are deployed to the ASF central repository need to
        be signed. To do this you will need to have a public and private keypair. There is a very good
        <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/people/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/">guide</a> that 
        will walk you though this.
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Apache Maven">
        <p>Install Apache Maven 3.0.3 or higher; we strongly
          encourage our committers to install 
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">Apache Maven 3.0.4</a>.
        </p>
      
        <p>As of Maven 2.1.0 you can now encrypt your servers passwords. We highly recommend that you follow this
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html">guide</a> to set your master password and
          use it to encrypt your ASF password in the next section.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="ASF settings">
        <p>Using the instructions from the previous step encrypt your Sonatype password and add the following servers to
          your 
          <code>~/.m2/settings.xml</code> file. You may already have other servers in this file. If not just create
          the file.

          <li>Clean up JIRA so the             
            <b>Fix Version</b> in issues resolved since the last
            release includes this release version correctly.  Also, transition any
            <b>Resolved</b> issues to the 
            <b>Closed</b> state.
          </li>
          <li>
            Update the <tt>CHANGES</tt> file in a working copy of the project root based on the Text release reports
            from JIRA.
          </li>
          <li>
            Update the 
            <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> site page by adding the new release artifacts with base 
            URL <source>http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/syncope/&lt;version&gt;/</source>
            and by moving current release artifacts to 'Older Releases' section, also changing base URL to <source>http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/syncope/</source>
          </li>
          <li>
            Commit any changes back to svn:
            <source>svn commit -m "updating files for release"</source>
          </li>
          <li>
            Perform a full build and deploy the SNAPSHOT artifacts:
            <source>mvn clean deploy</source>
          </li>
        </ol>

          <li>
            <strong>
              <em>Only for new major releases (like 1.0.0 to 1.1.0):</em>
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Create a sub-branch from which to make the release.
            <br/>
            Releasing from a branch will allow any cosmetic changes that need to be made for the release to be 
            approved to be done without preventing other more disruptive advances in the trunk from potentially 
            causing problems with the release. It also provides a future maintenance branch (like 1.0.x.)
            <br/>
            A branch can be made by running:
            <source>mvn -P apache-release release:branch -DbranchName=1_0_X</source>
          </li>
          <li>
            Checkout a clean copy of the trunk/branch to release using command line svn:
            <source>svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/syncope/trunk/ release</source>
          </li>

          <li>
            Do a dry run of the 
            <tt>release:prepare</tt> step.
            <source>mvn -P apache-release release:prepare -DdryRun=true</source>

            The dry run will not commit any changes back to SVN and gives you the opportunity to verify that the 
            release process will complete as expected.
          
            <p>
              <em>If you cancel a 
                <tt>release:prepare</tt> before it updates the pom.xml versions, then use the 
                <tt>release:clean</tt> goal to just remove the extra files that were created.
              </em>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Verify that the release process completed as expected:
            <ol>
              <li>The release plugin will create 
                <code>pom.xml.tag</code> files which contain the
                changes that would have been committed to SVN. The only differences between
                <code>pom.xml.tag</code> and its corresponding 
                <code>pom.xml</code> file should be the version
                number.
              </li>
              <li>
                If other formatting changes have been made you should review the changes and then commit them:
                <source>svn commit -m "fixing formatting for release"</source>
              </li>
              <li>
                Assuming the 
                <code>.tag</code> files look OK you may proceed and do any other validation you feel necessary.
                The following list may be helpful:
                <ol>
                  <li>Check 
                    <tt>release.properties</tt> and make sure that the scm properties have the
                    right version. Sometimes the scm location can be the previous version not the next version.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Verify signatures: On Un*x platforms the following command can be executed:
                    <source>for file in `find . -type f -iname '*.asc'`
do
  gpg --verify ${file} 
done</source>
                    You'll need to look at the output to ensure it contains only good signatures:
                    <source>gpg: Good signature from ...
gpg: Signature made ...</source>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                Once any failures or required updates have been committed to svn, rollback the release prepare files:
                <source>mvn -P apache-release release:rollback</source>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Run the 
            <tt>release:prepare</tt> step for real this time. You'll be prompted for the same version information and 
            optionally your GPG passphrase again.
            <source>mvn -P apache-release release:prepare</source>
          </li>
          <li>
            Backup (zip or tar) your local release candidate directory in case you need to rollback the release after 
            the next step is performed.
            <source>cd ..
tar -czf &lt;version&gt;.tar.gz &lt;version&gt;/

Discussion thread for vote on &lt;version&gt; release, with SVN source tag (r9999999).

For more information on the release process, check out http://www.apache.org/dev/release.html

Some of the things to check before voting are:
 - does "mvn apache-rat:check" pass on the source
 - can you build the contents of source release zip and SVN tag
 - do all of the staged jars/wars/zips contain the required LICENSE and NOTICE files
 - are all of the staged jars/wars/zips signed and the signature verifiable
 - is the signing key in the project's KEYS file and on a public server (i.e. http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/syncope/)
            </pre>

          </li>
          <li>A -1 vote does not necessarily mean that the vote must be redone,
            however it is usually a good idea to rollback the release if a -1 vote is
            received (see <a href="#Recovering_from_a_vetoed_release">&quot;Recovering from a vetoed release&quot;</a>).
          </li>
          <!-- <incubator-specific> -->
          <li>After the vote has been open for at least 72 hours, has at least three
            +1 PMC votes and no -1 votes, then post the results to the vote thread:
            <pre>To: syncope-dev@incubator.apache.org
Subject: [RESULT] [VOTE] Apache Syncope &lt;version&gt;

Hi all,
after 72 hours, the vote for Syncope &lt;version&gt; [1] *passes*

Thanks to everyone participating.

I will now submit the release for voting on the general@incubator.apache.org
