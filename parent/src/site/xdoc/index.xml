        <p>Apache Syncope is an effort undergoing
          <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">incubation</a>
          at
          The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly
          accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making
          process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
          While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
          it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
