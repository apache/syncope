    <p>The Syncope team is using the 
      <a href="http://repository.apache.org">Apache Nexus repository</a> for releasing SNAPSHOT and release artifacts.
      More details on releasing artifacts and using Nexus can be found on the Maven website at
      <a href="http://maven.apache.org/developers/release/apache-release.html">http://maven.apache.org/developers/release/apache-release.html</a>.

        <code>GPG</code> - The artifacts that are deployed to the ASF central repository need to
        be signed. To do this you will need to have a public and private keypair. There is a very good
        <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/people/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/">guide</a> that 
        will walk you though this.
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Apache Maven">
        <p>Install Apache Maven 3.0.3 or higher; we strongly
          encourage our committers to install 
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">Apache Maven 3.0.4</a>.
        </p>
      
        <p>As of Maven 2.1.0 you can now encrypt your servers passwords. We highly recommend that you follow this
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html">guide</a> to set your master password and
          use it to encrypt your ASF password in the next section.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="ASF settings">
        <p>Using the instructions from the previous step encrypt your Sonatype password and add the following servers to
          your 
          <code>~/.m2/settings.xml</code> file. You may already have other servers in this file. If not just create
          the file.

            Create a sub-branch from which to make the release.
            <br/>
            Releasing from a branch will allow any cosmetic changes that need to be made for the release to be 
            approved to be done without preventing other more disruptive advances in the trunk from potentially 
            causing problems with the release. It also provides a future maintenance branch (like 1.0.x.)
            <br/>
            A branch can be made by running:
            <source>mvn release:branch -DbranchName=1.0.x</source>
          </li>
          <li>
            Checkout a clean copy of the trunk/branch to release using command line svn:

            <source>mvn release:prepare -DdryRun=true</source>

            The dry run will not commit any changes back to SVN and gives you the opportunity to verify that the 
            release process will complete as expected.
          
            <p>
              <em>If you cancel a

                <code>pom.xml.tag</code> files which contain the
                changes that would have been committed to SVN. The only differences between
                <code>pom.xml.tag</code> and its corresponding 
                <code>pom.xml</code> file should be the version
                number.
              </li>
              <li>
                If other formatting changes have been made you should review the changes and then commit them:

              </li>
              <li>
                Assuming the 
                <code>.tag</code> files look OK you may proceed and do any other validation you feel necessary.
                The following list may be helpful:
                <ol>
                  <li>Check 
                    <tt>release.properties</tt> and make sure that the scm properties have the
                    right version. Sometimes the scm location can be the previous version not the next version.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Verify signatures: On Un*x platforms the following command can be executed:
<source>for file in `find . -type f -iname '*.asc'`
do
  gpg --verify ${file} 
done</source>
                    You'll need to look at the output to ensure it contains only good signatures:
<source>gpg: Good signature from ...
gpg: Signature made ...</source>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                Once any failures or required updates have been committed to svn, rollback the release prepare files:
                <source>mvn release:rollback</source>
              </li>
            </ol>

          <li>
            Run the 
            <tt>release:prepare</tt> step for real this time. You'll be prompted for the same version information and 
            optionally your GPG passphrase again.
            <source>mvn release:prepare</source>
          </li>
          <li>
            Backup (zip or tar) your local release candidate directory in case you need to rollback the release after

Subject: [VOTE] Apache Syncope &lt;version&gt;

I've created a &lt;version&gt; release, with the following artifacts up for a vote:

SVN source tag (r9999999):
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/syncope/tags/&lt;version&gt;/

Maven staging repo:
https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachesyncope-YYY/

Source release:
https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachesyncope-YYY/org/apache/syncope/syncope-root/&lt;version&gt;/syncope-&lt;version&gt;-source.tar.gz
https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachesyncope-YYY/org/apache/syncope/syncope-root/&lt;version&gt;/syncope-&lt;version&gt;-source.zip

PGP release keys (signed using ABCDEFG):
http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/syncope/KEYS

Vote will be open for 72 hours.

[ ] +1  approve
[ ] +0  no opinion
[ ] -1  disapprove (and reason why)

To: syncope-dev@incubator.apache.org
Subject: [DISCUSS] Apache Syncope &lt;version&gt;

Discussion thread for vote on &lt;version&gt; release, with SVN source tag (r9999999).

For more information on the release process, check out http://www.apache.org/dev/release.html

Some of the things to check before voting are:
 - does "mvn apache-rat:check" pass on the source
 - can you build the contents of source release (both .zip and .tar.gz) and SVN tag
 - do all of the staged jars/wars/tar.gz/zips contain the required LICENSE and NOTICE files
 - are all of the staged jars/wars/tar.gz/zips signed and the signature verifiable
 - is the signing key in the project's KEYS file and on a public server (i.e. http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/syncope/)
            </pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Perform a review of the release and cast your vote. For more details on Apache releases see
            <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/release.html">http://www.apache.org/dev/release.html</a>.
          </li>
          <li>A -1 vote does not necessarily mean that the vote must be redone,
            however it is usually a good idea to rollback the release if a -1 vote is
            received (see "Recovering from a vetoed release" below).
          </li>
          <li>After the vote has been open for at least 72 hours, has at least three
            +1 PMC votes and no -1 votes, then post the results to the vote thread:
            <ol>
